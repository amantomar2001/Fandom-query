## Early life[]

Lune was born to two scholars. The youngest of three children, she had an older sister, Stella, and an older brother, Sol. While her siblings appeared to make the most of their short time, neither had as much interest in their parents' research as Lune did. Their parents also ran a tight ship with any apprentices under them to train as Expeditioners, including Lune herself alongside a boy of the same age as her,Tristan. As such, this rubbed off on Lune, who took her job as an Expeditioner seriously. The family had at least one pet, a dog that Stella named Patte.

Lune metGustaveby chance, as Sol was dating Gustave's sister,Emma. She became acquainted withScielin Monolith Year 45: Sciel had lost her parents to the Gommage, which proved that Lune's parents, who had set off a year prior, had failed. Lune subsequently became withdrawn and cut Sciel out of her life, fully devoting herself to finishing her parents' work.

Lune joinedExpedition 33and helped determine its landing site, which she believed was whereExpedition Zero, the only one to reach the Monolith and return toLumièrewith survivors, landed. By this time she had also established herself as a prominent musician in Lumière.

## Expedition 33[]

Expedition 33lands on theDark Shoresand is nearly wiped out byRenoirand his army of monsters soon after. Lune survives the attack and makes her way to theSpring Meadows, where she reunites withGustave. They are subsequently joined byMaelleat theManor(viaFlying Waters) and Sciel at theGestral Village.

Left distraught after the death of Gustave at the hands of Renoir, Lune reconnects with Sciel as the two once again unite in mourning. She urges the Expedition to carry on, and promises to finish the job for Gustave. She also gradually forms a bond withVerso, the Expedition's newest member, and has the opportunity to pursue a romance with him.

Verso leads the Expedition toOld Lumièreto destroyThe Paintress's heart in order to disable the barrier protecting her, but his plan is thwarted by Renoir. Lune instead suggests that they forge a weapon from the hearts of the Axons, powerful enough to break the barrier. She delivers the final blow to one of the Axons,Sirène, on hereponymous island.

After defeating The Paintress at the top of the Monolith, the Expedition returns to Lumière as heroes. Their victory proves short-lived as Lune is Gommage'd along with the entire population, with the exception of Verso. She is later brought back to life by Alicia through her rediscovered Painter powers. Lune subsequently returns to Lumière and helps Alicia seize control of the Canvas by defeating her father.

In the "A Life to Paint" epilogue following Alicia's ending, Lune is seen attending Verso's concert at the opera house in the company of Alicia, Sciel and a resurrected Gustave.

In Verso's ending, Lune is erased as the Canvas is permanently destroyed. Alicia has a vision of Lune bidding her farewell in the subsequent "A Life to Love" epilogue.

## Notes[]

- Despite keeping a rather serious, "focus on the mission" attitude, Lune has a soft spot forgestrals, immediately showing excitement on meetingNocoand wanting to go see their village even though it didn't align with their expedition's mission.
