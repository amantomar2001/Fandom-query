\subsection*{Summary}\n\nJoseph Joestar, nicknamedJoJo, is the grandson ofJonathan Joestarand the main protagonist ofPart II: Battle Tendency. Raised by his grandmother Erina, Joseph showcased the ability to use Hamon at an early age, having inherited it from his grandfather and his mother,Elizabeth, who had gone into hiding. When the Pillar Men awaken from their two-thousand-year slumber, Joseph must train alongsideCaesar Anthonio Zeppeliin search of the power to defeat them.\\ \par \vspace{0.5cm}

Nearly five decades later, Joseph's daughter, Holly, is left on the brink of death when she develops a Stand thanks to the reappearance of Jonathan's killer, the immortal vampireDIO. Awakening a Stand of his own, Joseph sets out alongside his grandsonJotaro Kujoand the rest of theStardust Crusadersin order to kill DIO before Holly succumbs to her own power.\\ \par \vspace{0.5cm}

Another decade later Joseph would later arrive in Morioh, meeting his illegitimate son,Josuke Higashikata, whilst aiding the town in the hunt for serial killerYoshikage Kira.\\ \par \vspace{0.5cm}

Stamina:Superhuman, Joseph succeeded in completing his Hamon training alongside Caesar, andLisa Lisastated that he'd have to easily run 100km while wearing his breathing mask. | While still extremely fit for his age, his stamina has dwindled since his prime, thus causing him to get winded much sooner than he used to, despite that, it doesn't seem to noticeably hinder his capability to battle.\\ \par \vspace{0.5cm}

Range:Standard Melee Range,Extended Melee Rangewith clackers, potentially much further with other weapons and Hamon |Standard Melee Rangephysically, Varies with Hamon (Dependent on what it's being channeled through),Tens of Meterswith Hermit Purple (Ranked D in Range;[17]Stated to be superior to The World's 10-meter range[18]and wasused to grapple between buildings in the fight against DIO[19]), likelyKilometersin Part 4 (Planned to use Hermit Purple to find Red Hot Chili Pepper through Morioh's electrical grid[20]),Planetarywith Spirit Photography and other related abilities (Constantlyspied on DIO[21]whilehe was in Cairo, Egypt[22]from various places across the globe.Tried taking a picture of Josuke in Japan while he was in America[23])\\ \par \vspace{0.5cm}

Standard Equipment:His clackers, in addition to a number of other weapons, such as a Tommy gun and grenades. | His Stand, Hermit Purple.\\ \par \vspace{0.5cm}

Intelligence:Genius(Joseph's greatest weapon is his cunning and resourceful mind, which he uses to deceive and mislead his opponents by any means necessary. He can quickly analyze them and take note of every small detail to accurately guess their recent activities, and even more impressively, predict their next words. This allows him to easily psych out and confuse his opponents, many of whom underestimate Joseph due to his casual demeanor. In combat, Joseph makes use of everything available to him in his surroundings in addition to stage magic tricks such as prestidigitation to catch his opponents off guard, with attacks from unexpected angles and with any tool available. Oftentimes, he uses multiple tricks, intending one to be caught before it goes off, with a more subtle one waiting for its moment underneath. When possible, he prepares for fights ahead of time, heavily arming himself in wait for his fight withStraizoand immediately gunning him down and using his sleight-of-hand tricks to hit him with clusters of grenades. Joseph has absolutely no problem fighting dirty and excels in thinking on the spot and will not hesitate to simply run away if all else fails. Upon seeing a technique once, Joseph will attempt to formulate a counter to it, as seen when he countered Straizo's Space Ripper Stingy Eyes. He has even outsmarted the brilliant Pillar Men, who can comprehend complex technology and learn new languages within seconds, including strategic geniuses likeEsidisiandWamuu. His mind isn't the same in his old age, but Joseph still remains clever as always)\\ \par \vspace{0.5cm}

Weaknesses:Joseph must maintain a steady breathing rhythm to utilize Hamon, and if his breathing is cut off, he will be incapable of creating anymore Hamon. His ultimate technique drains all of his current Hamon, leaving him vulnerable for a brief time. As he ages, Joseph becomes increasingly stubborn and, as a result of neglecting his Hamon training, is less skillful in its use.\\ \par \vspace{0.5cm}

Notable Attacks/Techniques:\\ \par \vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{itemize}
\item Joseph's use of the clackers
\item Joseph gunning down Straizo
\item The secret technique of the Joestar family
\end{itemize}\\ \par \vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{itemize}
\item Hamon:Joseph was born with the ability to use the Hamon, also known asSendoand theRipple, thanks to his heritage, being the grandson ofJonathan Joestarand the son ofLisa Lisa. Drawing from the light of the sun and the steady breathing of its user, Hamon energy is used to combat beings of darkness such as zombies, vampires, and the Pillar Men. A user of Hamon can channel it through all sorts of objects, animate or inanimate, to reach a target. Liquids conduct Hamon especially well, but as it is reliant on the user's breathing, if this is cut off, the Hamon cannot be utilized. While Hamon is primarily a weapon against enemies weak to sunlight, it can be just as deadly against humans, as it can be used to kill a human being bystopping their heartif they aren't strong enough to take it.Clackers:In an attempt to come up with a technique able to harm even the Pillar Men, Joseph developed a style of combat centered around toy clackers. When infused with Hamon the clackers become dangerous weapons, capable of storing and building Hamon through repeated swinging and clacking whilst violently discharging when coming in contact with an object.Rebuff Overdrive:Joseph focuses large amounts of his Hamon into the points of his elbows whilst delivering a powerful strike, causing it to be more effective than any ordinary attack due to the energy being channelled into a single point. It's capable of piercing the skin of even the Pillar Men, who are already durable enough to resist and ignore most Hamon based attacks.Ultimate Hamon Overdrive:Presumably Joseph's ultimate attack, as the name would suggest. Joseph focuses all of his Hamon into one point and attacks a foe with it, this allowed him to overpower and shatter Kars' bone blade, which he himself previously assumed thathe had no chance of deflecting itdespite succeeding in doing exactly that with this technique. As a downside to its power, Joseph becomes vulnerable temporarily due to utilizing all of his Hamon into this technique.Zoom Punch:Just like his grandfather, Joseph uses the natural rejuvenation and pain nullification associated with Hamon to temporarily dislocate his shoulder and arm in order to extend his reach and strike opponents from a distance.Hamon Hair Attack:Joseph infuses strands of his hair with the Hamon, rendering them hard enough to block incoming projectiles and potentially forming a wall of Hamon-empowered hair to protect himself.

\begin{itemize}
\item Hermit Purple:Old Joseph's Stand, which he gained as a result ofDIO'susage of theStand Arrow. Manifesting as a cluster of thorny purple vines, wrapped around his arm, Joseph can use his Stand as a rope, whether to swing from place to place or tie up opponents. He can also use it to channel Hamon. Hermit Purple can also be used to check technology for things such as tampering or even manipulate and control it to an extent, such devices that Hermit Purple can interact with include but not limited to,televisions, cameras,planes,video game consolesand even a city's electrical grid.The Stand also grants Joseph the ability to communicate through it, allowing for him to talk with others in environments that he normally can't.Divination:Joseph can utilize Hermit Purple to take a psychic image of a far-off location or individual by destroying a camera, producing a photograph of the target. Hermit Purple allows Joseph to read the minds and thoughts of others, projecting the thoughts onto devices such as a TV, showcased whenprojecting DIO's inner thoughts on a TV despite being several thousand kilometers away due to their spiritual linkand iscapable of doing the same to those he doesn't share a link with, albeit at a needed much closer distance, performed in those instances by connecting Hermit Purple to a television, where he can display thoughts or communicate messages to others by flicking through random channels to form a sentence from the dialogue. It can even conjure amap on a substance such as dust or ash, showcasing the path to a desired item,in some cases even showing real-time movement of the item or target in question.

\item Secret Technique:The Joestar family's "secret technique". Usually utilized as a last resort, Joseph invented this move to use when battling the enemy seemed hopeless. The secret technique consists of carefully and quickly retreating from the opponent, while keeping a close eye on surroundings for things to use to defeat or assist in defeating them. To the untrained eye, it looks like Joseph is simply running away like a coward, augmented by his panicked shouting when doing so, but in reality it was actually used to stall time in order for Joseph to formulate a plan. He will also use this technique to try to lure an enemy away from others.
