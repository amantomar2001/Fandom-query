She has an opinion about the player: If you attack her, grab or eat her Neuron flies, do too many active actions, or leave the camera during a conversation, her opinion about the player may change for the worse. If opinion about player is very low, she is not going to talk to the player. You can increase your reputation only by bringing her neuron flies.
