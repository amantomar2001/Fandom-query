## Overview[]

Melina is the deuteragonist ofElden Ring. She is a mysterious, spectral woman who offers an alliance withthe Tarnishedto help them on their journey to become Elden Lord.

Melina may only be encountered when resting atSites of Grace.

## Background[]

Melina's burned hands

Melina has long observed theLands Between.[1]She was born at the foot of theErdtree.[2][3]She is a secret child ofQueen Marika, but not born of a mother. UnlikeMessmerorMorgott, Melina does not recall Marika with fondness.[4]

At some point long ago, Melina bore a vision of fire.[5]She was burned, leaving her bodiless;[6]a driftingspiritbound toGrace.[7]. Like her brother Messmer,[8]she was assigned a purpose by Marika.[3]However, she was unable to remember it. And so, Melina traveled with the spectral steedTorrentin search of theTarnishedwho would lead her back to the foot of the Erdtree. There, she may ascertain her given purpose.

## Game events[]

Melina offers an accord

Torrent identifies and selects amaidenless Tarnished,[9]who recently washed up in theStranded Graveyard, as one capable of brandishing the Elden Ring.[10][11]Melina descends the spectral steed to grant the fallen champion a set ofSacred Flasks, choosing to aid them in violation of theGolden Order.[12]

Sometime later, Melina approaches the Tarnished to offer them an accord: She could play the role of the missingFinger Maidenin return for a ride to the foot of the Erdtree.[13]If the player desires the strength ofrunes, and, if they accept the accord, Melina entrusts them with theSpectral Steed Whistleand, therefore, Torrent.[9]Melina advises them to follow the guidance ofGraceand seek theshardbeareratStormveil Castle.[14]

Once the Tarnished defeats thedemigod, Melina confesses that she was testing the Tarnished to see if they truly possessed the guidance of grace and if they were fit for the challenges to come.[10]Satisfied with her new companion, Melina offers to take them toRoundtable Hold, a gathering place for Tarnished champions.[15]

Throughout their journey, Melina also provides specks of guidance at certain sites of grace and, at churches dedicated toQueen Marika, she offers to reveal words spoken by Marika herself in the distant past.[16]

## Leyndell, Royal Capital[]

Melina looks for her purpose

Upon arriving at their destination, theRoyal Capitalat the foot of theErdtree, Melina thanks the Tarnished for escorting her and leaves to ascertain her purpose, claiming that she can govern her movement more freely there. She entrusts the power of runes and Torrent to the Tarnished.[7]She will also offer her aid should the Tarnished challengeMorgott, the Omen King, ruler of Leyndell and guardian of the Erdtree.

After defeating Morgott, the Tarnished finds the path into the Erdtree barred byimpenetrable thornsrefusing entrance to all. Melina, having ascertained her purpose and seeing the Tarnished stuck, rejoins the Tarnished to say that she can burn the Erdtree to gain entrance inside, provided that she can get ahold of theGiants' Flame. And hence, she asks to go on a new journey, this time to the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowyMountaintops of the Giants.[17]and tells them she will take care of the "kindling" required to set the tree alight.[18]

Defeating Morgott alsounsealsa path to theThree Fingers. If the Tarnished rests at the nearest grace from their entombment, Melina will warn against meeting them and insist against inheriting theFrenzied Flame, for it would end all lives and births, which she cherishes.[19]If the Tarnished heeds her warning, Melina and the protagonist will continue their journey for theflame of ruin.

## Cardinal Sin[]

Melina awakens the flame of ruin

When making their way to theForge of the Giants, Melina clarifies that she is now acting of her own volition, regardless of the purpose that her mother gave her.[20]After defeating theguardian of the flame, Melina puts her plan into action. She takes the Tarnished's hand, narcotizing them by doing so, and proceeds to sacrifice herself to channel the flame of ruin, setting the Erdtree aflame.[21]The Tarnished, maidenless once more, wakes up atCrumbling Farum Azula. There, they must confront theBlack Blade Malikethand recover theRune of Death. In this, Melina fulfills her purpose:"The one who walks alongside flame, Shall one day meet the road of Destined Death."[22]

## Destined Death[]

Melina vows to deliver Destined Death

If the player ignores her warnings at theFrenzied Flame Proscription, or just inherits the Frenzied Flame without speaking with her, she will say that The Tarnished is no longer fit, ending her accord, and forever leaving their side but threatening to kill them should they become theLord of Frenzied Flame.[23]

If Melina did not fulfil her purpose as Kindling Maiden, an additional cutscene will play after theLord of Frenzied Flameending. At theStone Platform, a chorus of whistling guides a transformed Melina to the Spectral Steed Whistle.[24]She retrieves the smoldering ring from a pile of ash and holds it in her open palm. As Torrent's final remnants are consumed by the Frenzied Flame,[25]Melina reveals her unsealed left eye and vows vengeance upon the player in the form ofDestined Death.[26][27]

## Dialogue[]

| Cutscene inStranded Graveyard |
| Don't worry Torrent, fortune is on his/her side. |
| We found him/her here, after all. |
| One of his/her kind is sure to seek the Elden Ring. |
| ...Even if it does violate the Golden Order... |
| Second encounter cutscene |
| Greetings. |
| Traveller from beyond the Fog. |
| I am Melina. |
| I offer you an accord. |
| First encounterGracedialogue |
| Have you heard of the Finger Maidens? |
| They serve the Two Fingers, offering guidance, and aid, to the Tarnished. |
| But you, I am afraid, are maidenless. |
| I can play the role of maiden. |
| Turning runes into strength. |
| To aid you in your search for the Elden Ring. |
| You need only take me with you. |
| To the foot of the Erdtree. |
| Accept |
| Then it's settled. |
| Summon me by grace to turn runes into strength. |
| Ahh, another matter. |
| I bequeath to you this ring. |
| Use it to traverse great distances. |
| It will summon a spectral steed named Torrent. |
| Torrent has chosen you. |
| Treat him with respect. |
| Refuse |
| I understand. I'm asking you to put faith in but a stranger. |
| Yet I'm certain that we can reach an understanding. |
| Summon me by grace if you should reconsider. |
| If talked to again after refusing |
| Have you reconsidered my offer? |
| Level up |
| Shall I turn your runes to strength? |
| Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment. |
| Share them with me. Your thoughts, your ambitions. |
| The principles you would follow. |
| Talk |
| This tiny golden aura is the grace of the Erdtree. |
| This light once shone in the eyes of your Tarnished brethren. |
| But now it is all that guides you. Or so I hear. |
| You can see them, can't you? |
| The rays of grace, that guide you through your burden. |
| Talk |
| Me? |
| I'm searching. |
| For my purpose, given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree, long ago. |
| For the reason that I yet live, burned and bodiless. |
| There is something for which I must apologise. |
| I've acted the Finger Maiden, yet can offer no guidance. |
| I am no maiden. My purpose…was long ago lost. |
| Talk |
| Upon the cliff, in Castle Stormveil, is a shardbearer. |
| A demigod who inherited a fragment of the shattered Elden Ring. |
| If the rays of grace signal the castle, then the Elden Ring beckons you. |
| As an ally by pact, ...I pray that you are fit... |
| To face the challenge presented by the Ring. |
| When resting at a Site of Grace after leavingLimgrave |
| Forgive me. I've been...testing you. |
| To see whether or not grace truly does guide you. |
| And...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails. |
| It seems my worries were unfounded. |
| Torrent had your measure from the very start. |
| Whereas I merely pretended. |
| There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance. |
| I can take you to the Roundtable Hold... |
| Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace... |
| Accept |
| Very well. |
| Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment. |
| When resting at a Site of Grace inAltus Plateau |
| The Erdtree...is close. |
| Only a little further till the foot of the Erdtree, and the accord is fulfilled. |
| It takes me back. |
| I was born at the foot of the Erdtree. |
| Where mother gave me my purpose. |
| Though now, everything is lost to me. |
| I...have to ascertain for myself. |
| The reason for which I live, burned and bodiless. |
| AboutBoc |
| Your seamster, Boc... |
| He is always eager to see your return. |
| Please, will you talk to him, when you can? |
| I'm sure he would be much contented. |
| About Boc |
| Your seamster, Boc... |
| I see him crying, from time to time. |
| I think he misses his mother. |
| He wants someone to tell him he's beautiful. |
| Does being born of a mother... |
| Mean one behaves in such a manner? |
| When resting at theEast RampartSite of Grace |
| My utmost thanks. |
| For bringing me to the base of the Erdtree. |
| Here, I can govern my own movement. |
| And thus, the accord is fulfilled. |
| I shall depart to ascertain the purpose I was given. |
| Farewell. |
| I shall leave Torrent, and the power to turn runes into strength, here with you. |
| I wish you luck, in realising your ambition. |
| You have fought long and hard. |
| I have no doubt you will become Elden Lord. May you take the throne. |
| When resting at theElden ThroneSite of Grace after defeatingMorgott |
| Hello again, old friend. |
| It's me, Melina. Your travelling companion. |
| Allow me a moment to converse with you. |
| You were unable to enter the Erdtree, no? |
| Prevented by the mantle of barbs. |
| The thorns are impenetrable. |
| A husk of the Erdtree's being; that spurns all that exists without. |
| The only way to stand before the Elden Ring... |
| and become the Elden Lord...is to pass the thorns. |
| My purpose serves to aid in that very act. |
| So I'd like you to undertake a new journey, with me. |
| To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants. |
| Then I can set the Erdtree aflame. |
| And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord. |
| Talk |
| I wish to journey with you once more. |
| To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants. |
| Then I can set the Erdtree aflame. |
| And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord. |
| After talking toEniaafter defeating Morgott |
| Think not, of the kindling. |
| I shall see to that. |
| All I ask of you is to make the journey. |
| To the snowy mountaintops of the giants, far above the clouds. |
| I know... |
| I'm asking you to commit a cardinal sin. |
| But it must be done to reach the path beyond. |
| And that is the path I wish to travel. |
| What is your mind? |
| When resting at aSite of Gracewith an Echo of Marika for the first time |
| Spoken echoes linger here. |
| Words of Queen Marika, who vanished long ago. |
| If you wish, I will share them with you. |
| Refuse |
| Of course. Perhaps there is no need. |
| Tell me if you should change your mind. |
| Echoes of Marika (First Church of Marika) |
| In Marika's own words. |
| Hark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds. |
| Guidance hath delivered ye through each ordeal, to the place ye stand. |
| Put the Giants to the sword, and confine the flame atop the mount. |
| Let a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life. |
| Brandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree! |
| Echoes of Marika (Grand Lift of Dectus) |
| In Marika's own words. |
| The Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine. |
| Become one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it. |
| To wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart. |
| Echoes of Marika (Third Church of Marika) |
| Very well. In Marika's own words. |
| My Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace. |
| With thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between. |
| Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die. |
| Well? Perhaps that might serve you in lieu of a maiden's guidance. |
| Echoes of Marika (Minor Erdtree Church) |
| In Marika's own words. |
| I declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order. |
| Through understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased. |
| Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past. |
| My comrades; why must ye falter? |
| Echoes of Marika (Church of Pilgrimage) |

| When resting at theFrenzied Flame Proscription |
| If you intend to claim the frenzied flame, |
| I ask that you cease. |
| It is not to be meddled with. |
| It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending. |
| However ruined this world has become, however mired in torment and despair... |

| You...have inherited the frenzied flame. |
