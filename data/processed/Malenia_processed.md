Malenia, Blade of Miquella, later known asMalenia, Goddess of Rot, is an optionalremembrancebossinElden Ring. She is aDemigodShardbearerwho is encountered inElphael, Brace of the Haligtree.

## Background[]

Malenia was a disciple of theBlind Swordsman

Malenia was one of the twin children born toQueen Marika the Eternaland her secondElden Lord,Radagon.[2]AsEmpyreans, both Malenia and her elder twin brother,Miquella,[3]were candidates to ascend asgodsof a new age.[4]However, due to the nature of their parentage, the twins were afflicted with dreadful curses. Miquella was doomed with eternal nascency, while Malenia's body was ravaged by thescarlet rot.

The scarlet rot plagued Malenia from within, gradually consuming her and leaving her disfigured. Over time, she lost her eyes and several limbs to the rot. Despite her suffering, Malenia fought valiantly to suppress the rot’s influence, refusing to succumb to its ruinous nature.[citation needed]

Miquella worked tirelessly to undo the curses they had both inherited. While unable to find a cure for his sister within theGolden Order, Miquella designed aneedleofunalloyed goldto keep the rot at bay.[5]He also crafted the prostheses that enabled her to continue fighting.[verification needed]

At some point, Malenia encountered the legendaryblind swordsmanof theFlowing Curved Sword, who had long ago sealed away anOuter God of Rot.[6]The swordsman became her master,[7]enabling her to gain wings of unparalleled strength.[8]Malenia eventually became a peerless warrior and her brother's sworn blade and protector.

## The Shattering[]

Malenia's Great Rune

After the Elden Ring wasshattered, Malenia claimed a shard of the fracturedElden Ring.[2]She would attract loyal servants like herCleanrot Knights, who vowed to fight next to her, despite the inevitable gradual putrefaction of their flesh.[9]

During theShattering, Malenia led an army that marched south from theHaligtreedown theBellum Highway. She won many battles against the other Demigods, even humbling fellowshardbearer,Godrick the Grafted,[10]who groveled at her feet for mercy after first insulting her and then suffering defeat.

Malenia and Radahn in Caelid

Malenia and her half-brotherRadahnwould eventually be the last two demigods left standing in the conflict. Their forces clashed in theCaelid Wilds, and the two fought theBattle of Aeonia, a bitter duel to fulfill an unhonored vow.[11]In the midst of the combat with Radahn, Malenia unleashes Scarlet Rot, resulting in her firstrotflower bloom.[12]

The rot did not kill Radahn but robbed him of his wits, turning him feral. Malenia herself was left slumbering in a coma. She was rescued by one of her Cleanrot Knights,Finlay, who carried her across theLands Between.[13]When Malenia and Finlay took refuge at theShaded Castle,Maleigh Marais, the sickly-born head ofHouse Marais, was naturally drawn to the unconscious Demigod.[14]He saw in her his personal goddess.[1]Finlay carried Malenia back to the Haligtree,[13]far north of the Erdtree.[15]

## Aftermath[]

The unleashed scarlet rot devastated Caelid, leaving it a rotting wasteland, and created theSwamp of Aeonia. Malenia inadvertently brought forth theScarlet ButterfliesandKindred of Rot. The pests, includingSage Gowry, who worshipped her as a goddess and hoped to cause her to bloom once again, believing that she would usher in a new age of rot.[16]However, Malenia rejected her fate and never embraced theServants of Rot.[17]

Miquella had encased himself within the Haligtree in an effort to create a new Erdtree of his very own, hopefully granting him the power to cure both his and his sister’s curses.[citation needed]However, during Malenia's absence, Miquella was ripped from the womb of the tree and taken away byMohg, Lord of Bloodbefore he could emerge from hiscocoon. Malenia dreamt while awaiting Miquella's return, and the scarlet rot seeped out from her and began infecting the Haligtree.

## Game events[]

Malenia dreamt for ages

Malenia's slumber is eventually disturbed by aTarnished, who found their way to the roots of the Haligtree. The two fight and Malenia finally meets her match, but she suffers her first true defeat. However, in the end, Malenia succumbs to the Scarlet Rot and blossoms yet again, reborn as a nascent goddess. She unleashes her full fury against the invader, but falls short yet again, her dying words an apology to her vanished brother. Having bloomed twice, Malenia withdraws within her scarlet blossom.[18]

## Soundtrack

Malenia is fought at the end ofElphael, Brace of the Haligtree, in a large chamber beyond theHaligtree RootsSite of Grace.

Her arena is a wide cavern with a shallow pool of water in the middle. There are no obstacles, so there is plenty of space to gain distance during some of Malenia's more devastating attacks.

- Malenia will regain lostHPwith every successful attack, even if they are blocked.
- Malenia is among a group of few select enemies that need to be parried multiple times for a successful riposte, another beingRadagon.

## Moveset[]

| CollapseMoveset List |
| Slash | Phase 1 & 2 |
| Slashes horizontally with her sword. May chain together multiple slashes. She may close distance by lunging towards the player before attacking. |
| Grab | Phase 1 & 2 |
| Steps back and pulls back her hand, before lunging forwards and grabbing at the player. If the grab lands, she throws the player into the air and impales them, before throwing them to the ground. Can be cancelled by dealing sufficient damage during the wind-up, or avoided by dodging to the side. |
| Running Slash | Phase 1 & 2 |
| Strafes the player and slashes horizontally. |
| Upwards Slash | Phase 1 & 2 |
| Holds back her blade and swings it forwards, leaping up into the air and then performing a downwards slash. |
| Kick | Phase 1 & 2 |
| Performs a spin-kick. |
| Rapid Slashes | Phase 1 & 2 |
| Retracts her blade and performs three quick slices, followed by a fourth after a short delay. |
| Thrust | Phase 1 & 2 |
| Leaps into the air and thrusts forwards with her blade. |
| Waterfowl Dance | Phase 1 & 2 |
| Leaps into the air and hovers for a period, before performing many rapid slashes that cover the area around her. Performs four bursts of slashes, homing in on the player with each burst. This attack is very difficult to dodge at close proximity, but it is possible to roll through the attacks or run away. |
| Scarlet Aeonia | Phase 2 |
| Hovers in the air, surrounded by red tendrils. Dives towards the player and spawns a giant flower where she lands. The flower blooms and releases a cloud of Scarlet Rot around her. She will perform this attack immediately when phase 2 begins, and it can be avoided from any range by sprinting sideways until the flower blooms. |
| Scarlet Plunge | Phase 2 |
| Leaps into the air and falls back down, plunging her blade into the ground and creating an explosion of rot in front of her. |
| Flying Slash | Phase 2 |
| Leaps into the air and performs a sweeping attack followed by a thrust. |
| Scarlet Phantoms | Phase 2 |
| Hovers in the air, creating a pool of Scarlet Rot directly beneath her. She releases several phantoms towards the player, which will perform slashes and thrusts before disappearing. After the last phantom vanishes she dives towards the player. |

## Phase 1 - Malenia, Blade of Miquella[]

In phase 1, Malenia will primarily make use of melee attacks using her sword. Her quick attacks, combined with her HP regeneration on hit, mean that she can rapidly recover from any damage dealt. However, she staggers easily, and her attacks can be cancelled by attacking during her wind-up animations. Frostbite and Blood Loss are especially good for staggering her.

## Phase 2 - Malenia, Goddess of Rot[]

Once her health reaches 0, a cutscene will play, instigating phase 2. Malenia, now with large wings, gains a variety of Scarlet Rot-based attacks, and many of her regular attacks can now inflict the status effect. She will begin the phase with 80% of her maximum health, but can recover this using her HP regeneration. This phase will always begin with a Scarlet Aeonia attack, which can immediately end the fight if the player does not immediately get some distance. She can also create phantom projections of herself, which will attack and then disappear.

## Notes[]

- Malenia has a prosthetic right arm, left leg, and right foot. These were added due to the infection of the scarlet rot. The rot has also visibly spread over her eyes, so she is presumably also blind. Neither seems to influence her battle prowess in the slightest, however.
- According to theScarlet AeoniaIncantation description, Malenia will become a true Goddess if her scarlet flower blooms three times. She first used this spell during theBattle of Aeonia.[12]Malenia blooms a second time during her duel againstthe Tarnished.[19][20]The "Demigod Slain" flyout is displayed upon defeating Malenia, Goddess of Rot.
- The "Demigod Slain" flyout is displayed upon defeating Malenia, Goddess of Rot.
- Once defeated, she will leave behind a large, solidScarlet Aeoniain her arena. If the player has theUnalloyed Gold Needleafter completingMillicent's questline, it can be given to the Aeonia to receiveMiquella's Needleand aSomber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone.
- Millicentand herfour sistersare descended from Malenia in some way, but more as offshoots, or buds, of her Scarlet Bloom rather than actual daughters. Millicent seeks to return Malenia's sense of dignity.[21]They will be reborn as Malenia'sScarlet Valkyriesif their deaths coincide with a great betrayal.[22]
- They will be reborn as Malenia'sScarlet Valkyriesif their deaths coincide with a great betrayal.[22]
