His unpredictability, ferocity in combat, and accomplishments as the captain of theShimano Familyearned him the nickname "The Mad Dog of Shimano" (嶋野の狂犬,Shimano no Kyōken). He is the former patriarch of theMajima Family, the founder and former president ofMajima Construction, and the former vice-chairman of theTojo Clan.

## Profile

## Appearance

Majima has a lean build, which he utilizes to achieve incredible levels of speed and agility. His hair is styled into a side part that hangs to the tops of his ears, with the rest being shaved into an undercut. He also sports a full goatee.

InYakuza 0, he wore his hair long enough to be pulled into a low ponytail, and was clean shaven with a stubbly mustache.

He is missing his left eye, which was gouged out for insubordination in 1985. His eyelid remains intact.

Majima's full tattoo

Majima's tattoo covers his biceps and upper chest, stretching from his neck to the back of his thighs. It consists of a floral motif (similar to Shimano's), with aHannyaWPon his back and twin snakes wrapped around his arms and chest.

The Hannya on Majima's back

The Hannya mask has commonly been used to depict women who have turned into demons as a result of being consumed by sorrow, envy, or rage. Snakes are often associated with rebirth and transformation, due to their tendency to shed their skin.

In the originalYakuza, his tattoo is not the Hannya; it is instead a blue entity that resembles an Oni that only covers his left breast.

Majima in 1985

Majima's attire remains mostly the same throughout the series, usually consisting of a yellow boa print snakeskin blazer, a gold chain, black leather pants, a black leather belt with a silver buckle, black leather gloves, and black steel toed snakeskin dress shoes. InYakuza 0,Yakuza, andYakuza 2, his eyepatch is blank. FromYakuza 3onward, his eyepatch is adorned with a silver snake.

InYakuza 0, he wears a black tuxedo over a white wingtip collar pleated tuxedo dress shirt, black winged tip dress shoes and with a black satin bow tie and cummerbund if he is working at the Grand.

InYakuza Kiwami, Majima wears his signature snakeskin and black leather outfit, with an additional gold chain. He is seen wearing several different disguises forMajima Everywhere, which include a black tuxedo similar to the one seen inYakuza 0when encountered as a bartender, a white Hannya mask (missing its jaw) while disguised as "Hannya-Man," and an idol outfit consisting of silver double breasted satin jacket with matching pants as "Everyone's Idol Goro." The jacket is light blue with a pink star pattern on the lapels and cummerbund, along with an orange feathered headband adorned with the same pattern in yellow. He wears white boots with the outfit, though when it is worn inYakuza 0while performing24-hour Cinderella, they are white roller skates instead. His drag persona,Goromiwears a hot pink snakeskin bodycon dress and a blonde wig. Majima is also seen dressed as a taxi driver and a police officer.

InYakuza 3,Yakuza 4, andYakuza: Dead Souls, in addition to his usual outfit, he is also seen wearing a charcoal grey suit over a red dress shirt and black tie. He is rarely shown without his black leather gloves or steel-tipped black leather shoes, though he is not wearing gloves during his and Kiryu's arena match inYakuza 3. He is shown to have worn a yellow baroque patterned button-up shirt, light gray slacks, and a black leather belt with a gold buckle prior to the Ueno Seiwa hit in aYakuza 4flashback.

## Personality

Right, wrong... Nobody's got a clue what the difference is in this town. So I'm gonna have more fun... and live crazier than any of 'em.

Majima is a resourceful, charismatic, and commanding man. He has gained the respect of friend and foe alike, often due to his ferocity and skill in combat. He is also a successful businessman and is surprisingly pragmatic, as shown by his success with The Grand and Club Sunshine, and later his construction company, Majima Construction. This has also lead to him being favored by his superiors, sometimes to his detriment, as is the case withTsukasa Sagawa. Despite being the patriarch of his own family - and later, lieutenant advisor to the sixth chairman,Daigo Dojima- he dislikes serious meetings and often finds a way to showily barge his way into them. Majima is also extremely cynical about the Tojo Clan, possibly stemming from the mistreatment he experienced from them inYakuza 0. His baseball bat is a weapon of choice. He even shared mutual passion for baseball withHomare Nishitani.[16]

Majima is shown to have a soft spot for his family members, even if he is prone to physically punishing them for their disobedience.Nishidaconsiders him to be sentimental and deep down, a "softie," seeing him mope around before Kiryu plans to leave for Okinawa. He is shown to hold on very closely to the past, and never forgets a promise, though he says his memory can be spotty at times. Majima also has a fondness for zombie movies and potentially for bizarre martial arts films, including titles such asDeadly Thumb Wrestling!andLegend of the Drunken Fist: Essence of Champagne. Majima appears to have a sense of care for the environment as well, stating "separatin' your trash is a man's civic duty! Ya gonna be there to take responsibility when we got toxic-ass dioxins floatin' around?!"

His loyalty is impressively enduring - particularly when it comes to Saejima, and laterKiryu- though he also has a tendency to be obsessive, especially when it comes to the latter. Majima believes he is the only one entitled to kill Kiryu, and has nearly died trying to protect that right. As time progresses, it appears to become more of a running joke between the two rather than a true threat.

He commonly reminds others that he has standards to uphold as a yakuza, despite his theatrically unhinged persona, and states that he dislikes dishonorable men, especially ones that intentionally break rules. As a young adult, he is shown to go out of his way to help civilians endangered by yakuza affairs, especially women and children, who he has a soft spot for. Despite this, he is not above carrying out many of the more unsavory aspects of the job if necessary. Not as recklessly selfless as Kiryu, he will still put himself before strangers, however, as seen inYakuza 5, he is more than willing to sacrifice his own life for the sake of those he truly cares about, agreeing toKurosawa'sdeal in order to call offHaruka'sassassination, and to spare Saejima's life.

His "Mad Dog" act is primarily inspired by three men — three paragons of the "tenacity" he strives for[17]— whom he becomes familiar with inYakuza 0:Homare Nishitani, a man who lives for thrill, putting excitement and the pursuit of pleasure above all else,Wen Hai Lee, who uses his strength to protect the ones he loves, andTsukasa Sagawa, who, as Majima says, is "damn near immortal." To Sagawa, he vows to "have more fun and live crazier than any of 'em."

At the beginning ofLike a Dragon:Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, he still retains his fake Kansai accent even when he is hit with amnesia. Even whenNoah Richis attacked by Keith's lackeys, he still retains the righteous mindset to protect vulnerable children and women. However: As the fight goes on, he started becoming extremely vengeful when he recalls his days starting out as a Yakuza. He also retained description of his hometown ofKamurocho, while making no mention ofSotenbori. He later was described byMinamiandNishidathat he has mellowed out a lot, given that Minami bore the brunt of much of Majima's punishment and his bat.

## Background

Preparing for the hit

Apart from enjoyingmangaWPas a kid[18], nothing about Majima's childhood, parents, or how and why he became a yakuza, is known. His chronological first appearance is in 1985, at age 20, when he was a member of theTojo Clan'sShimano Familyand was oath brothers withTaiga Saejima. He and Saejima discuss the upcomingUeno Seiwa Hitthey were soon to carry out, intending to promote theSasai Familythat Saejima belonged to, by assassinating theUeno Seiwa Chairman. Majima brought with him a bag containing 6 revolvers, each loaded with 6 bullets. Majima expressed concern for the safety and wellbeing of Saejima's sisterYasuko, as it was likely that they could end up endangered or imprisoned, but Saejima simply brushes him off, saying that it is "bad luck."

Majima being tortured by Shibata's men

Unbeknownst to them both, the revolvers were loaded with rubber bullets, and the entire hit was a setup orchestrated byIsao KatsuragiandKazuo Shibata. On the day of the hit, Shibata ordered Majima to not carry out the hit, as theDojima Family- which the Shimano Family was a subsidiary of at the time - refused to hold joint responsibility for their actions. When Majima refused, insisting on not abandoning his oath brother, Shibata and his lackeys attacked him. Despite his best efforts, he was overwhelmed by their numbers and ended up chained to a pole. Even still, Majima resisted, refusing to bow to anyone but men he respects. One of Shibata's henchman picked up a knife and gouged out Majima's left eye, before leaving him at the mercy ofFutoshi Shimano. Meanwhile, Saejima was left to carry out the hit alone, and ended up sentenced to life in prison.

Majima imprisoned in Sotenbori

Majima was tortured in a yakuza black site prison dubbed "the hole" for a whole year. Shimano noticed Majima's tenacity and refusal to break, and in 1986, released him into the custody of his oath brother in theOmi Alliance,Tsukasa Sagawa. Majima was held captive inSotenbori, Osaka, under Sagawa's surveillance and command, but was promised by Sagawa that Shimano would reinstate him into the Tojo Clan if he could make 100 million yen as the manager ofCabaret Grand.

## Involvement

## Yakuza 0: 1988-1989

The customer is king.

Handling the customer with class and wit expected from the Lord of the Night

Majima reluctantly falls into his role of "Lord of the Night" (夜の帝王, Yoru no Teiou), turning the Grand around and making it one of the most well known attractions in Sotenbori. Despite this, he is unhappy, having to avoid confrontations and be walked all over by the Grand's customers, and suspects Saejima will eventually break out of prison to kill him for his betrayal.

Majima hears out Sagawa's offer

After a night where he deals with an unruly drunk, he meets his quota, but Sagawa raises the mark up to 500 million, giving Majima a choice of either continuing with his work at the Grand or accepting a job that will clear the debt immediately.

Majima reluctantly agrees to carry out a hit onMakoto Makimura- in part, due to Sagawa's threats - despite having never killed anyone before. Sagawa tells Majima that his target is a ruthless pimp that forces college girls into working for him through a telephone club. Majima is then given just two days to kill Makimura.

Majima heads off to the telephone club, connecting with a woman who says that she knows a Makoto Makimura, and she leads him to a massage parlor owned by the man, also known as God Hands.

A sudden meeting

When he finds Makimura's massage parlor,Hogushi Kaikan, he unsheathes his dagger and rushes inside, only to find the place empty. As he's about to leave, a young woman accidentally walks into him, immediately believing he's a thief. Majima quickly abates her fear by telling her that he's one of Makimura's patients. The woman, who Majima soon realizes is blind, insists upon giving him a massage to alleviate his alleged pain. Majima falls asleep during the massage, and is awoken by the sound of Makimura walking in, who sees his full back tattoo and realizes that he's a yakuza.

Makimura sends the woman out for an errand run and then attacks Majima. After their fight, a group ofOmi Alliancemembers barges in, demanding a Makoto Makimura. Majima looks over in confusion at the man he's bested when the woman returns, and it is revealed that she is the realMakoto Makimura. The Omi Alliance members kidnap Makoto and shoot the man previously thought to be Makimura. Before he loses consciousness, he begs Majima to keep Makoto safe.

Majima vows to keep Makoto safe

Majima chases her down, and sneaks Makoto away, ending up in an alley where Makoto clings to his leg and cries. Majima hesitantly pulls out his dagger, knowing that he must kill her in order to complete the task given to him by Sagawa, but his conscience won't allow it, and he instead decides to keep her safe.

Later, once they are safe in a borrowed storage shed, Majima questions Makoto as to why the yakuza are after her. Though she says that doesn't entirely know herself, she reveals her past of being a human trafficking victim, which caused her to go blind as a result of psychological trauma.

It wasWen Hai Lee- the man who Majima had previously thought to be Makoto Makimura - that rescued and later took her in. Majima sympathizes with Makoto and gives her a few vague details of his own similarly traumatizing past. Majima is confused as to why a blind woman wears a watch, and Makoto concedes that it's a bit ridiculous and discards her watch. Majima is seen putting it into his pocket.

Majima then goes to meet up with Lee, and hears out his plan to escape Sotenbori and get both Majima and Makoto to safety and away from the Omi Alliance's grasp. Lee's plan is to kill a body double in Makoto's place, but Majima refuses to let an innocent person die for their sake, and fights Lee again in order to prevent him from carrying out the plan on his own.

Majima discards the bag containing security camera pictures of their mark along with a spare uniform of Makoto's in a park trash can, only to find out the next day that the double was murdered anyways at the hands ofHomare Nishitani, the patriarch of theKijin Clan.

When Majima fights Nishitani at the Grand, he reveals that there are two sides in the conflict, and that he is being paid by a Tojo benefactor to bring Makoto back before Sagawa's men kill her.

After the altercation between him and Nishitani, Sagawa asks Majima about the hit he's supposedly carried out, suspicious about the state of the body - with the girl's face bashed in to the point of her being unrecognizable - and why he'd been so careless as to have it be discovered in the river. Majima dismisses it, and says he was simply nervous due to it being his first time killing anyone.

Majima returns to the warehouse, where Sagawa's assassins find him, Makoto and Lee. The three are forced to make a last-ditch attempt to escape from Sotenbori, but before they can flee the city, Lee is killed by his van exploding, leaving Majima and Makoto injured and helpless from the blast. Sagawa appears, scolding Majima for disobeying him once again. He is about to kill them both whenMasaru Seraarrives and shoots Sagawa in the back, knocking out a desperate Majima and forcibly taking Makoto away.

Bonding and getting information from Nishitani

Majima ends up at the mercy of Sagawa, who proceeds to torture him for his insubordination, only sparing him because Majima is the only one he suspects can get information about Makoto's whereabouts from Nishitani, who has taken a liking to him.

Majima finds Nishitani through the corrupt copBilliken, who brings him to the jail cell Nishitani is quite comfortably residing in. Nishitani tells Majima everything he knows about the situation and reveals that Makoto has been taken by theNikkyo Consortium, run byMasaru Sera, to a brothel called Camellia Grove. As they attempt to leave, Nishitani and Billiken are killed by a bribed guard, and Majima escapes to tell Sagawa where Makoto is held.

Sera tests Majima's resolve

Together Majima and Sagawa travel outside the city limits ofSotenbori, and Majima fights his way to Sera, who tells him the truth about Makoto holding the deed to the empty lot. Sera gives Majima a choice between keeping Makoto safe or killing him to find her himself, to which Majima throws down his gun and puts his trust in Sera. However, Sagawa appears from behind Sera and shoots him, and stealsKazuma Kiryu's business card from his breast pocket. Sagawa then takes Majima to Kamurocho in order to track down Makoto for themselves.

Learning the shocking truth

Once there, Majima is told that Shimano wants to see him. Shimano reveals that he was the one who ordered Sagawa to order Majima to kill Makoto. However, Shimano never actually intended for Majima to kill Makoto. He wanted Makoto to willingly give the land over to Shimano and Sagawa, with Majima's help, so that Shimano could rise to power, dethrone Dojima and have the Tojo clan under Omi dominance. Shimano simply gave the kill order so that he could humiliate him for his unwillingness to murder.

Mortified at the realization that he has been manipulated from the start, Majima goes off on his own - taking matters into his own hands, he fights bothOsamu KashiwagiandAkira Nishikiyamafor information on Makoto's whereabouts. When he does find Makoto at the site of the empty lot, Makoto begs him to kill Dojima's lieutenants in retaliation for their part in her brother's death, but Majima declines her offer of 1 billion yen, pleading for her not to not go down a road she'll regret.

Birth of the Mad Dog

The two of them go out to get takoyaki, but Makoto gives him the slip, sending a delegate to tell him to meet her tomorrow if he decides to help her avenge her brother's death. Majima shows up at the Vacant Lot but is greeted by Shibusawa's men, who tell him that Makoto has arranged everything herself and is already meeting with Dojima and his lieutenants. He beats down the assassins and rushes to the Sebastian Building only to arrive at the very moment she is shot byLao Gui. Majima is stricken with grief and anger and tears his way through everyone that stands between him and Makoto.

Once he defeats the last of Dojima's men, he kneels before Makoto and quickly realizes that she's still breathing. Sera appears with his men and rushes Makoto to the hospital. As the doors to the operating room shut, Majima breaks down, vowing that he'll grant her wish of eliminating the Dojima Family. He goes on a rampage through Dojima HQ, defeatingHiroki Awanoand Lao Gui. He is stopped from killing Dojima by Sera, who reveals that Makoto has given him possession of the land, and that Makoto has recovered but is now in a coma. Sera demands one last task from Majima: to kill Shimano for his betrayal to the Tojo clan and for conspiring with the Omi Alliance.

Majima returns to the boss' office with a gun in his hand. Facing his boss, he prepares to take the fall for the murder of his patriarch in exchange for his return to the yakuza. However, he ultimately decides not to kill Shimano, and instead asks for the truth of Saejima's fate in exchange for his own life. To preserve his own life, Shimano kills the Omi delegate he had been negotiating with, and tells Majima it was in his intention to send him to Sotenbori and reinstate Majima back into the clan.

One month later, he meets with Sagawa for the final time, telling him that he's going to "live his own way," inspired by the likes of Lee and Nishitani, and to a lesser extent, Sagawa himself. He walks away, not realizing that Sagawa was promptly killed afterwards.

Majima runs into Makoto again, who is being harassed by fellow Shimano family members. He saves her, not saying a word so as to not reveal his identity to her. Majima did this so that Makoto wouldn't come looking for him, thus putting herself in danger. He leaves Makoto in the hands of her current loverTateyama, the doctor who had been helping her regain her sight, and tells him to keep her safe.

A rivalry between legends

Majima crosses paths with Kiryu as he walks down the streets of Kamurocho, and greets him with the newfound enthusiasm of the Mad Dog of Shimano: "Yo. [...] Kiryu-chan!"

## 1989-1992

After the resolution of the Empty Lot Dispute and his return to Kamurocho, Majima befriendsNaoki Katsuya, an action film actor at the time, and marriesMirei Park, who is an aspiring idol at the time. Katsuya is injured and can no longer continue acting, so Majima negotiates with the local Sotenbori yakuza to get him into the talent industry as a producer, leading to the formation ofOsaka Talentin 1992. Soon after, his marriage with Park ends poorly when Majima learns that Park had aborted her pregnancy without telling him, leading to him hitting her and divorcing her afterwards. It is unclear whether or not they still hold affections for the other.

## Yakuza/Yakuza Kiwami: 1995-2005

Stop teasin' and let's get on with it, Kiryu-chan!

Majima's introduction.

Now 31, Majima initially appears in the alley behindSerenato find one of his own family members sprawled out on the ground withKazuma Kiryustanding over him. Majima decides to "take responsibility" for his subordinate's attack on Kiryu, striking him repeatedly with an umbrella. Kiryu grabs Majima by the arm and tells him to stop. Majima, disappointed, complies with Kiryu's request, though warns that Kiryu must learn to enforce discipline for when the time comes that he becomes the patriarch of his own family.

Yakuza Kiwami:Kiryu responds to Majima's advice, stating that he will discipline his family but will do so his way, with "logical methods." Feeling challenged, Majima asks Kiryu if he's looking for a fight. Kiryu refuses, sternly stating that it would not be logical, apologizing for causing any offense. This angers Majima further, who continues to goad Kiryu into a physical confrontation by striking him across the face multiple times with his umbrella, before finally threatening him with his knife. Kiryu stands calmly and refuses to hit back, asking if Majima is satisfied. Impressed by Kiryu's strong resolve, Majima backs down, telling Kiryu that "this world isn't logical" and that he risks getting himself killed if he refuses to change. Majima leaves, excited at the prospect of fighting Kiryu in a real battle one day.

Once Kiryu is released from prison, Majima tracks down and challenges him to a fight. He is disappointed by the deterioration of Kiryu's fighting skills, anddecides to plan increasingly elaborate ways to get Kiryu to fight himin order to restore hisabilities.

Fight atYoshida Batting Center.

Majima and his subordinates then attackMakoto Dateand kidnapHaruka Sawamurato lure Kiryu out, so that he and Majima can face off at theYoshida Batting Center. After reassuring Kiryu that Haruka is safe, they fight, and Majima is defeated once again. One of Majima's men rushes Kiryu with a knife, but Majima jumps in front of him, shielding Kiryu from harm. He vows to Kiryu that he'll be the one to kill him someday; not one of his lackeys. Majima collapses, and is dragged off by his men.

Yakuza Kiwami:Majima warns Kiryu that several former Dojima Family members are pursuing Kiryu and suggests that he meet them at Shibaura Wharf, where they plan to exact their vengeance on Kiryu for the death of patriarchSohei Dojima. Kiryu and Majima join forces for the first time, and manage to fend off the men, but Majima is wounded in the attempt. He falls into the water, but Kiryu states he doesn't have time to waste checking if Majima is alright, then leaves.

Taking a hostage atShangri-La.

Later on, while Kiryu and Haruka are atShangri-La, Majima crashes through the front of the building with a truck, causing it to collapse and the occupants to flee. He once again confronts Kiryu and takes a woman hostage. She refuses Majima's advances, saying she won't be unfaithful to her boyfriend, and Majima immediately lets her go, saying that he respects honest people. Kiryu and Majima battle once more, and in the end, Majima is defeated yet again. He smiles, acknowledging Kiryu's strength before falling unconscious.

Yakuza Kiwami:After Kiryu returns to Kamurocho following the fight between the Shimano and Kazama Families at Shibaura Wharf, he receives an email from Majima regarding the death of Shimano, his patriarch. Rather than swearing revenge, Majima tells Kiryu that Shimano's business was his own and that Kiryu can feel safe knowing that he would suffer no recompence from Majima or the members of his family, before adding that any further fights between them would be entirely between them, not any kind of revenge for Shimano's death.

Majima has a variety of different appearances inYakuza Kiwami's addedMajima Everywherefeature, including:

- Officer Majima
- Goromi
- Zombie Majima
- Everyone's Idol Goro
- Taxi Driver Majima
- Hannya-Man

## Majima Saga: February 2006

Majima sits in the captain's chair

In February 2006, the Tojo Clan is in disarray under the leadership ofYukio Terada, whose conflicting ideals as a former Omi Alliance member (a focus on monetary gain over earned power and respect) do not go over well. A power struggle between the patriarchs of each major family is underway, most notably betweenAkinobu Uematsu,Kei Ibuchi(and to a lesser extent,Osamu Kashiwagi) for position as clan captain. Majima believes that neither of them are fit to run the Tojo Clan, and puts together enough money to overtake Uematsu's position and put himself in the running to become clan captain. His goal is not truly to become Terada's right-hand man, only to change the criteria to give the other patriarchs (most likely Kashiwagi) a less biased chance to lead the clan.

Majima finds Uematsu dead

He is picked up by his subordinateRyota Kawamura, who he briefly discusses his thoughts with (saying that he does not trust Terada, Uematsu or Ibuchi, and that he believes it's been a set-up from the start), and returns to Kamurocho. Upon his arrival, a group of yakuza jump him - who he assumes are Uematsu's men. He defeats them, and learns that his family office was targeted as well. He rushes to the Majima Family office, where Nishida reports that Kawamura has gone missing. Majima suspects that Uematsu is the one that planned the attack and heads to Uematsu's office to confront him, only to find him dead, a bullet through his forehead.

Majima returns to Tojo Clan Headquarters and tells the other clan members that Uematsu was dead before he got there, but Ibuchi attempts to use it as leverage (saying that it only makes sense that Majima was the one to kill Uematsu since they had been rivals for the captain's seat) to increase his own chances of becoming clan captain. Majima vows to find proof that he was not the one to kill Uematsu, and seeks outThe Florist of Sai(thanks to information given to him by Kashiwagi) who - in exchange for Majima's promise of runningPurgatoryin his absence - supplies him with security footage showing that Kawamura had been at the scene of the crime just before Majima. The Florist tells him that Kawamura was last seen in Sotenbori, and Majima reluctantly sets off to find him.

Majima reluctantly returns to Sotenbori

Upon his arrival in Sotenbori, he visits theCabaret Grand, under new management since his departure. He asks the hostesses there to keep him updated in case Kawamura returns, then leaves to investigate further. On his way to the cabaret club Odyssey, he bumps into its former owner,Yamagata, who is walking out of the club that took Odyssey's place. He tells Majima that Kawamura had been frequenting a mahjong parlor aboveHogushi Kaikan. When Majima visits the massage parlor, the receptionist tells him that Kawamura has been to the massage parlor, but she hasn't seen him for quite some time. She mentions his gambling debts, which Majima realizes had been cleared around the time he joined the Tojo Clan. He thanks her, and goes to leave, but she guilts him into getting a massage in exchange for information she gave him. He relents and asks for the quickest, shortest massage course they have.

Makoto and Majima, reunited

As Majima waits for his massage, a woman walks in and introduces herself as Makoto Tateyama. Majima immediately recognizes her asMakoto Makimura, and hides his face in order to prevent her from recognizing him. During the massage, Makoto notices him looking at her watch, and recounts the story of Majima saving her, not knowing that he is the man she desperately wants to thank. She tells him that the watch's band had worn out some time ago, and she was forced to replace it with a new one that she doesn't like as much. She also mentions that the reason she had continued to work at the massage parlor where they first met was in the hopes of seeing Majima again in order to thank him. After the massage, as he's on his way out, Makoto asks if they've met before. Majima shakes his head no, but quietly tells her that the massage has "worked out some knots that [he's] had for 18 years."

Majima vs. Kawamura

The hostess he had met at the Grand contacts Majima, and informs him that Kawamura showed up and killed an Omi Alliance member. Majima rushes over to stop him, and Kawamura admits to killing Uematsu, saying that he has to kill both Uematsu and Majima in order to gain his freedom. He and Majima fight, and after he loses, Majima demands further answers from him, but he is shot and killed by Ibuchi, who admits to paying off Kawamura's debts in exchange for his loyalty. He had planted Kawamura within the Majima Family, intending on forcing Majima to take the fall for inciting conflict between the Omi Alliance and Tojo Clan.

Majima fights Ibuchi, who in the end, instead of submitting and allowing himself to be arrested, shoots himself in the head, which Majima makes no effort to stop.

He returns to Tojo HQ, and informs Terada of what happened in Sotenbori. With their limited options, Majima proposes a last-ditch solution to repair relations and avoid an all-out war with their newly weakened state. They meet withJin Godaand his lieutenants, and Majima offers to disband his family as reparations for his subordinate's actions. Though his lieutenants seemingly disagree with this outcome, hoping for a war, Goda accepts.

Majima goes on to dissolve his family, and creates his construction company,Majima Construction, taking over Purgatory and beginning work onKamurocho Hills. It is later revealed that Majima had bought Makoto a replacement strap for her wristwatch, and she is content knowing that she finally got to thank him for all that he had done for her.

## Yakuza 2/Yakuza Kiwami 2: December 2006

How the fuck should I know how this tangly-ass rainbow shit works!?

Majima keeps good on his promise

With Terada having been supposedly killed by theGo-Ryu Clanand theNishikiyama Familythreatening to leave the Tojo Clan, Kiryu tracks Majima down atYayoi Dojima's request, and they fight in a cage match with the promise of Majima's aid if Kiryu wins. Although he still considers himself retired, Majima explains the current state of affairs to Kiryu, recounting the year following Kiryu's own departure from the Tojo Clan. Terada has apparently been running the clan quite poorly, taking on a pacifist stance and putting a focus on money over power. On top of that, after Majima left and disbanded his family, Kashiwagi was made Clan Captain; but had been sidelined by Terada, being unable to make decisions without his explicit approval. Warning Kiryu about Terada's hidden agenda, he offers his support to Kiryu.

Yakuza Kiwami 2:After the conversation, Nishida reports that thugs have attacked their construction site, and Majima reveals to Kiryu that thugs have been attacking his business to scoop up the deal on the Kamurocho Hills project. Despite their retribution, they have been unable to defend their assets, which has slowed down the progress of the construction considerably. Kiryu lends his support and helps in the defense, acting as a foreman and freeing up Majima Construction to help the Tojo Clan.

Taking on the Sengoku's men single-handedly

He is next seen taking on all of Sengoku's men sent to the town single-handedly and warns Kiryu thatShindohas betrayed the clan after being bribed by Sengoku. Majima, having sustained grave injuries while fighting off the army of rival yakuza on his own, is left inKaoru Sayama's care while Kiryu rushes off to Tojo HQ.

He recovers quickly, and assists in disarming the bombs hidden around the city with the help of his construction team.

Majima tells Kiryu to finish offRyuji Godaand theJingweon Mafiaat the final showdown, warning him not to be killed, as he expects a rematch between them.

## Yakuza 3: 2007-2009

The Mad Dog needs swaying from the Dragon once again

With the Jingweon Mafia and the Omi Alliance dealt with, Kiryu meets with Majima at the top of Millennium Tower. Majima laments Kiryu's departure, saying he'll miss having him around when he leaves for Okinawa. Kiryu pleads with Majima once more to go back to the Tojo Clan and support the newly-appointed Sixth Chairman,Daigo Dojima, as a contingency for any future troubles. Majima, reluctant at first since he didn't want to "babysit," becomes intrigued by Kiryu's assurance that he would be able to run amok and cause chaos to assist the survival of the clan. Majima then explains that he is only swayed by strength, and implies that he will only accept this favor by force. Majima loses, promises Kiryu he will return to the Tojo clan and is left to wonder what he's gotten himself into.

Majima reunites with Kiryu

When Kiryu returns to Kamurocho in 2009, Date suspects Majima is the one to betray the Tojo Clan over the resort deal. Kiryu refuses to believe this, saying that he trusts Majima to keep his promise, and heads to Purgatory to confront him. Upon his arrival, he is greeted by an immense number of Majima's family members. Majima appears, asking Kiryu to follow him to the now-defunct Underground Coliseum where they are able to talk quietly. Before Majima can answer any further questions, Kiryu must beat him in a cage match. After losing once again to Kiryu, he reveals that he got involved for Daigo's sake and that he was blackmailed byGoh Hamazakias a suspect of the clan's inner dispute.

The Florist takes Majima and Kiryu to his monitor room to discuss theKazama lookalikewhen they see theSnake Flower Triadinvading Kamurocho. After Kiryu defeats them,Yoshitaka Minearrives to show them that Kanda has been killed, and adds that theHamazaki Familyhas been destroyed. With two more Tojo heads out of the game, Kiryu asks Majima to take care of the now-leaderlessKazama Family, as Kashiwagi had been gunned down.

After saving Kiryu from Land Minister Suzuki's private army outside of the Diet Building, Majima offers to send his family in Okinawa as assistance, which Kiryu refuses. Majima wishes him luck and tells him not to be beaten by Mine and the CIA, as he vows to be the one to kill him someday.

The construction of Kamurocho Hills is still ongoing throughout the events of the game, with Majima Construction actively working towards its completion.

## Yakuza 4: 2010

Akiyama is informed why Yasuko is sought after

Majima gives up his position as a Lieutenant of the Tojo Clan, accepting a position of lower responsibility in order to bring in new members to the clan.

Majima follows the trail ofYasuko Saejima, the stepsister of his oath brother,Taiga Saejima. Majima sendsDaisaku Minamito track Yasuko at the club she works at,Elise. Eventually Majima decides to enter the club on his own, but is disappointed at the lack of her presence and he begins lamenting about his past.

Saejima demands answers, Majima promises answers the only way he sees fit

Majima later hears of Saejima's arrival in Kamurocho and sends Minami off to find him. The two reunite and head to the batting cages for a fight. After Saejima defeats Majima, he recounts his side of the story to Saejima, clearing up any doubts he may have had about Majima's supposed betrayal. The two sworn brothers lament that they are getting older, and Saejima comments that the Kansai accent that Majima fakes has improved since they last saw each other.

Daigo sells out Majima to the police

Kiryu, on his way to see Majima upon returning to Kamurocho, witnesses his arrest and calls out to him. Majima tells him that it wasDaigo Dojimawho set him up and that everything - the 1985 hit, ten billion yen incident, and Yasuko - are all connected. He asks Kiryu to help Yasuko, and says that he's the only one who can save the Tojo clan, lamenting that Kiryu is all that the clan has left.

Despite his arrest, he is seen out of prison alongside Daigo as the Tojo Clan congratulates Saejima for his return and inaugurates him as a patriarch.

## Yakuza 5: 2010-2012

Forget money. A yakuza ain't worth dust without strength. Ya let that slip, someone else is gonna come gunnin' for your spot.

Saejima and Majima have a talk over yakiniku, where Saejima discusses needing to prove his own worth by going back to prison in order to be able to guide the lower-ranking yakuza as the clan's new captain. Majima goes to the batting center and has his family attack Saejima there to test his strength. Before Saejima goes to prison, Majima tells him to come back strong.

Daigo Dojima, desiring to ease the increasing tensions between the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance, ventures to Fukuoka and sends two officers to other parts of Japan to form alliances with the local yakuza families. Majima is sent to Hokkaido for the sake of negotiations with theKitakata Family. Despite his claims for peace, Fifth Chairman of the OmiTsubasa Kurosawaorders assassins to kill Majima mid-negotiation. Majima survives but is wounded in the altercation.

Kurosawa orders local newspapers to report Majima as being dead, so as to demoralize the Tojo Clan and incentivize Kiryu to attack Kurosawa's inter-Omi Alliance rival,Masaru Watase. This in turn causes Saejima to break out of prison in order to learn the truth of Majima's supposed demise, despite Majima's best efforts to keep him out of it.

Majima takes advantage of his presumed death to make contact with both his ex-wifeMirei Parkand Omi Alliance chief memberNaoki Katsuya. He sends Park a letter, which would then lead to her untimely death at the hands of the very traitor that Katsuya and Majima had intended to lure out,Kamon Kanai.

Unfortunately, Majima's position is found out by Kurosawa, and he and his men take over the Millennium Tower, capturing and torturing Majima. When Saejima arrives on the rooftop to confront Kurosawa, he is forced to fight against an already injured Majima, and is given an ultimatum: either he kills Majima (ending with his arrest for murder and the collapse of the Tojo Clan with two of their top lieutenants gone), or he dies by Majima's hands, eliminating him from the picture and setting Kurosawa's other plan in motion.

Majima reveals that the reason he was unable to resist Kurosawa was the threat towardsHaruka Sawamuraat her debut concert. Kurosawa has stationed a sniper ready to kill her mid-concert at the Japan Dome. He tells Saejima that he couldn't refuse because she meant more to Kiryu than anything else and that the two of them are very expendable in comparison. Though Saejima expresses concern about Majima's condition, Majima goads Saejima into fighting by explaining it was he who expelled Saejima from the Tojo Clan, out of fear for his life. Regardless of the circumstances, he is grateful for the excuse to fight Saejima again, and the sworn brothers fiercly fight to a stalemate. Majima is delighted to discover Saejima's prime strength has returned, and Saejima compliments Majima's fighting as well. Kurosawa, angered with their refusal to fight any further, orders the sniper to shoot, but they've already succeeded in buying enough time forTatsuo Shinadato subdue the would-be assassinShigeki Baba, and Daigo arrives with help from Katsuya to save both Saejima and Majima.

## Yakuza 6: 2012-2017

Saejima being arrested

In December 2012, Majima is briefly seen waiting outside of Kiryu's hospital room with Saejima shortly after Kurosawa's scheme had been foiled. The police show up to arrest Saejima, which Majima protests, but Saejima insists that he has to serve out the rest of his sentence in order to live as a free man.

The top members of the Tojo Clan are blamed for their alleged involvement in the Little Asia fire, leaving onlyKatsumi SugaiandTakumi Someyain control after Daigo and Majima are arrested.

Saejima, Daigo and Majima outside Tojo HQ

They are not seen again until early 2017, after Kiryu had bargained for Daigo's release from prison. Majima asks Daigo how the Tojo Clan should proceed with Kiryu's apparent death by theYomei Alliance. Daigo shows them the letter he received from Kiryu and states he intends to follow his wishes for avoiding a war with the Yomei. The three return to leading the Tojo shortly after.

## Yakuza: Like a Dragon: 2017-2019

Some time in 2017, the Tojo Clan are targeted by the new Governor of TokyoRyo Aoki's Kamurocho 3K Plan, an initiative designed to stamp out crime in the city. Sensing possible dangers, the leaders of the Tojo - Daigo, Majima and Saejima - met withMasumi Arakawaand hatched a plan. Arakawa would seemingly turn traitor, leaking information to the police to ensure the success of the plan, while the senior Tojo Clan members would escape Kamurocho with his assistance. For the next three years, Majima would be in hiding with Daigo and Saejima, under the care ofNick Ogata, a business associate of Daigo's.

Majima attends a private meeting with Arakawa inOmi Alliance HQ, alongside Daigo and Saejima. While there, the sworn brothers come acrossIchiban Kasugaand his party, who had just knocked out a group of Omi guards. Kasuga and his group mistake Majima and Saejima for Omi officers, a concept that Majima does not bother to correct them about, as Majima wants nothing more than a good fight to kill his boredom. After a lengthy battle between them, Majima and Saejima agree to "stop holding back" against Kasuga, before being stopped by Arakawa and Daigo, with Majima becoming annoyed that he won't be able to finish his fight with Kasuga after they're revealed to be on the same side.

Later, Majima assists in protecting Daigo andMasaru Wataseduring their joint dissolutions of the Tojo Clan and Omi Alliance, and is visibly overjoyed when Kiryu suddenly reappears to protect Watase from an Omi officer's knife attack.

Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name:After the dissolution, Majima exits the Omi headquarters alongside Kiryu (going by "Joryu"), Saejima, Daigo, Watase, andYuki Tsuruno. Majima invites his companions to a party to celebrate the end of the yakuza, but is turned down by "Joryu", who firmly insists that he is not the man Majima takes him to be. Majima exasperatedly says that he will play along, but earnestly tells Kiryu to not leave them just yet. They are then ambushed byKosei Shishidoalong with a large mob of Omi members in one last desperate attempt to keep the age of yakuza alive. Majima joins Saejima and Kiryu in attacking Shishido, before assisting in keeping Shishido's men busy while he and Kiryu battle in the Omi main office. After Shishido's defeat, Majima joins the others inAkame's limousine.

In the days immediately following the dissolution, Majima and Saejima repel assassins aiming to kill Daigo and Watase.

Much later, Majima attends the funeral for Arakawa and Ryo Aoki, and is apparently going along with Daigo and Watase's plans to open a legitimate security firm inSotenbori. He gives Kasuga advice on carrying on Arakawa's legacy, but immediately states that his calm demeanor will disappear after the day is over.

## Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth: 2023

With the security company having failed due to slander from theTatara Channel, Majima now lives as a fisherman in a remote village alongside Saejima and Daigo in order to prevent the former Tojo yakuza from rising, as they believe their influence would be enough to start a revival. They are soon visited by Kiryu and his newfound party, who explains to them that he has cancer. Though clearly upset by the news, Majima knows Kiryu well enough to not argue with him, and invites him to stay over for drinks.

Kiryu asks that the trio assistJo Sawashiroin defeatingSeiryu ClanchairmanMasataka Ebinaand preventing the yakuza from being shipped toNele Islandto die of radiation poisoning. After refusing this request, Kiryu attempts to rile their fighting spirits by insulting their pride. Upon witnessing a hurt Daigo reluctantly charge Kiryu, Majima throws his tanto at them to intervene. After a long battle which ends in a draw, Kiryu attempts to rise his friends one last time before leaving, telling them that they must be responsible for their actions. The three beg Kiryu not to throw his life away, but he leaves for Tokyo without saying another word. As he watches him leave, Majima begs one last time for Kiryu to stay with the three of them.

After some time, the three decide to take Kiryu's advice to heart, and arrive in the nick of time at the Millenium Tower to assist Kiryu and his party. Saejima rescues Kiryu and his party from a helicopter with a gatling gun by firing a rocket launcher at it, with Majima taunting the pilot as he flies away. The three then assist Kiryu in a heated battle against the former Omi officers. Though the officers put up a good fight, Majima, Saejima, Kiryu, and Daigo easily triumph, and the three instruct Kiryu to go forth and defeat Ebina while they take on the remaining Ex-Omi officers. In doing so, the three triumphantly state they are done hiding.

After Kiryu defeats Ebina once and for all, Majima, Daigo, and Saejima burst through the doors, having defeated all of the Seiryu Clan. They witness a heavily battered Kiryu tearfully beg Ebina not to pursue a pointless revenge, before collapsing due to exhaustion. A distraught Majima screams Kiryu's name as Kiryu passes out in Daigo's arms.

Majima, Saejima, and Daigo later witness Kiryu be taken away in a helicopter to a hospital.

## Other Media

## Yakuza: Dead Souls

InYakuza: Dead Souls, Majima is first shown watching zombie movies in his office in Millennium Tower. Prior to the events of the game, Majima is instructed to work on tightening security for the grand opening ofKamurocho Hillsby Daigo Dojima, asRyuji GodaandTetsuo Nikaido- both members of the rival Omi Alliance - have been spotted in Kamurocho.

He escapesMillennium Tower, which has been overrun by zombies, only to receive a phone call fromAzumiberating him for being late for the grand opening. He arrives only to find that it's been put under quarantine, and that he must protect the people holed up inside the building from the zombie invaders. WithDaigo Dojima's help, he brings the refugees to safety inPurgatory, but in the process is bitten by a zombie.

He fears he may soon become one, and distances himself from the survivors to prevent any possible danger to them. When Kiryu andMisuzu Asagihappen upon him, still waiting for his inevitable demise inside of Kamurocho Hills, he asks Kiryu to kill him for fear of becoming an unstoppable threat. He shows them the secret entrance to Purgatory, then bids them farewell, walking off towards the quarantine zone.

Majima vows to outlast the zombie toxins

He wanders around on his own, taking down every zombie he sees until he comes up with the idea to try to "detox" himself after he happens upon a sauna. The idea is to "sweat out" all of the zombie toxins to prevent him from turning. He is not seen again until the end of the game, where it is revealed that the zombie who bit him had dentures, which did not transfer the poison into his arm, despite breaking the skin. It is also revealed that the reason his eye had turned red is because it was allergy season, not because he was turning into a zombie.

## Ryu Ga Gotoku Online

## Project x Zone 2

Along withHeihachi Mishima, he savesPhoenix WrightandMaya Feyfrom aB.O.W.attack. He asks who is responsible for theThanatosattack, and Heihachi tells him thatShadaloois the main organization responsible for the attack in Kamurocho.

## SEGA Heroes

Majima was a playable hero inSEGA Heroes. He was a yellow legendary hero released in 2020, along with three other Yakuza characters.

## Yakuza

Majima is fought twice inYakuza, bolstered by several goons in the first, and alone in second. He attacks primarily with swift stabs and cuts, with a number of kicks too. He frequently chains quicksteps to circle around Kiryu, making him difficult to land a hit on. His moveset consists of:

- a Rush Combo made up of a two-handed low thrust, a high right Thai roundhouse kick, a high right spinning heel kick, a diagonal downward left slash, and a left cross aimed at the crotch;
- a diagonal downward left slash-rightward horizontal before stepping back,
- a ducking straight knife thrust,
- a running overarm low thrust before stepping back,
- a leaping two-handed reverse-grip knife plunge (2nd fight only),
- a spinning right heel sweep kick (2nd fight only),
- a left back kick as a directional attack,
- twoHeat Actiongrab attacks, including:a front grab Heat Action where he slashes at Kiryu before grabbing him in a guillotine hold, before throwing him to the ground and stabbing him; anda rear grab Heat Action where he throws Kiryu over his shoulder, before leaping in the air and stomping on him;

- a rear grab Heat Action where he throws Kiryu over his shoulder, before leaping in the air and stomping on him;

His attack trails and dodge aura are indigo purple, and his punch attack is followed by orange explosion effects.

## Yakuza 2

Majima sports a far more basic moveset inYakuza 2, retaining few of his attacks from the first game, with only a couple of extra ones. However, he is still highly mobile, and can strafe and run in circles around Kiryu in addition to quickstepping. His moveset is comprised of:

- his Rush Combo, downed attack and taunt; as well as
- a left cross aimed at the crotch,
- two knockdown reversals, including:jumping back on his feet after being knocked back before throwing a dashing right cross, anda back flip after being launched in the air before throwing a dashing right cross; and
- jumping back on his feet after being knocked back before throwing a dashing right cross, and
- a back flip after being launched in the air before throwing a dashing right cross; and
- two get-up attacks, including:a windmill breakdance when down on his front, anda rising windmill when down on his back.
- a windmill breakdance when down on his front, and
- a rising windmill when down on his back.

- jumping back on his feet after being knocked back before throwing a dashing right cross, and
- a back flip after being launched in the air before throwing a dashing right cross; and

- a windmill breakdance when down on his front, and
- a rising windmill when down on his back.

## Yakuza 3

Majima has two boss fights inYakuza 3: in the first one, he takes Kiryu on unarmed, and uses his signature tantō in the second.

Majima uses a modified version of his regular moveset in hand-to-hand combat. His knife attacks have been changed to knifehands, punches and palm strikes, while his kicks remain unaltered. His moveset is listed as follows:

- a combo comprised of a downward diagonal right slap, a right outward knifehand, a high right Thai roundhouse kick, and a high right spinning heel kick;
- a ducking right cross,
- his low left cross,
- a running right palm strike,
- his spinning heel sweep kick,
- his directional attack,
- grab attacks, including:a large outer reap as a front grab attack,a generic enemy back grab attack, andhis back grab Heat Action fromYakuzawhen grabbing Kiryu from the front;
- a large outer reap as a front grab attack,
- a generic enemy back grab attack, and
- his back grab Heat Action fromYakuzawhen grabbing Kiryu from the front;
- two get-up attacks, including:a turning right heel sweep kick when down on his front, andhis back get-up attack fromYakuza 2; and
- a turning right heel sweep kick when down on his front, and
- his back get-up attack fromYakuza 2; and
- his taunt.

- a large outer reap as a front grab attack,
- a generic enemy back grab attack, and
- his back grab Heat Action fromYakuzawhen grabbing Kiryu from the front;

- a turning right heel sweep kick when down on his front, and
- his back get-up attack fromYakuza 2; and

Majima's movesets fromYakuzaandYakuza 2are merged into one for his second boss fight. He also has a vast number of new attacks, including:

- a combo consisting of a downward diagonal left slash, a rightward horizontal slash, and a straight knife thrust;
- a running underarm knife thrust,
- his unarmed front grab attack,
- a right push kick as a guard reversal,
- Kiryu'sKnockdown Reversal, which can stun Kiryu;
- a back cartwheel kick as a dodge attack, and
- his unarmed get-up attacks.

In Heat Mode, Majima will begin rapidly chaining quicksteps like in the previous games, making it much harder to land hits on him.

He emits a violet aura in Heat Mode.

## Yakuza 4

Majima reprises most of his knife moveset fromYakuza 3, except for his front grab Heat Action and front get-up attack; however, he has gained some extra moves, which include:

- a combo made up of a flying knife thrust, a rightward horizontal slash, a leftward horizontal slash-spinning left hook kick, a right downward tornado kick, and a spinning downward diagonal left slash;
- another combo made up of a front flip double kick, a spinning two-handed underarm thrust, a low leftward horizontal slash, a right rising kick, and a front flip downward slash; and
- his front get-up attack fromYakuza 2.

In Heat Mode, Majima can perform an attack where he rapidly twirls around on his left leg with his knife held out, quickly dashing towards Saejima eight times to slash him. Afterward, Majima will revert back to his calm state, kneeling on the ground to catch his breath.

## Yakuza 5

Majima's moveset in this game is hisYakuza 4moveset, but he is now capable of creating shadow doppelgangers, all of whom can attack independently. It appears that he is able to create these copies through nothing but his own speed.

## Yakuza 0

Majima makes his playable debut with the ability to switch between different fighting styles never displayed in the series before. Mirroring Kiryu, he has four styles revolving around a default balanced style that is effective in most, if not all situations; a style focused on power that relies on slow but immensely strong attacks and increases resistance to enemy attacks; a style focused on speed to hit enemies quickly while dodging just as fast to avoid being hit; and a secret, legendary fighting style that the character in question will canonically adopt as their fighting style for the rest of the series.

Majima is skilled in the use of many weapons, including nunchaku, swords, knives, bats, and batons. Compared to Kiryu's brute swinging, Majima wields them with proper technique and training, which mainly came fromFei Hu. His choice of empty handed combat appears to be hapkido mixed with dirty fighting techniques. Compared to the later chronological games, Majima is rarely seen wielding his tantō in the story; it is only seen when he attempts to fightWen Hai Leewith it before being disarmed, when he contemplates carrying out the hit onMakoto Makimura, and when he nearly killsLao Guifor endangering Makoto. Uniquely, unlike Kiryu and other protagonists, he does not have a default knife Heat Action; however, he can use the Heat Action that is available the moment they are brandished, as well as when an enemy is next to the wall or other furniture.

## Yakuza Kiwami

During story boss encounters, Majima's default fighting style when fought is the0version of Mad Dog style, with a chance to doYakuza 2's series of knife QTEs in most of them. He stays in this style throughout the first fight after Kiryu gets out of prison, and since Kiryu can only get a few upgrades at this point in the game and has lost the ability to use Kiwami Moves while Majima has 3 health bars, defeating Majima here is nearly impossible. However, managing to do so rewards Kiryu with 100 EXP Orbs, giving the player a massive head start in upgrades.

At Sera's funeral service, Majima uses a simplified Thug style against Kiryu, and does not have much health.

In subsequent encounters, after starting in Mad Dog, Majima enters Heat mode with another style. At the batting center, Majima switches to Slugger style at half health, and in the second encounter at Shangri-La, he switches to Thug style after the QTE. While these may seem like downgrades, inYakuza Kiwami, both styles are significantly more powerful than Mad Dog.

While in Slugger style at the batting cages, Majima cannot be interrupted during combos - unlike Mad Dog - and his heavy damage and wide swings may cause Kiryu to lose a large amount of health if caught in a combo. Just two hits from Slugger style are enough to break Kiryu's guard.

While in Thug style at Shangri-La, Majima's long-winded and relentless attack combos with very few openings can allow him to get many hits in on Kiryu if not careful, while his ability to recover from parries and single hits increases in speed. This makes it difficult to effectively attack him without his response. His dodging speed and distance are also enhanced, allowing him to get behind Kiryu very easily and attack the moment he approaches. This issue is further exacerbated by Majima's ability to perform Essence of the Thug: Choke Out, if he manages to get behind Kiryu, dealing heavy damage. Other Heat Actions he can do on Kiryu in both fights include his twoYakuzaheat actions, theYakuza 3heat action where he throws Kiryu to the ground before jumping in the air and stomping on his chest with both feet, Essence of the Thug: Finisher when Kiryu is on the ground facing upwards, and a kick to the midsection when on the ground facing downwards.

Within the Majima Everywhere system, Majima will utilize any one of his fighting styles depending on the encounter, including Breaker. Like Thug, Breaker leaves very few openings to attack, and often attacks the legs, forcing Kiryu to resort to keep him out of range or using equipment that allows for blocking leg attacks. The Kiwami move to perform corresponds to Majima's fighting style. Thug corresponds to Essence of Extreme Brawler; Breaker corresponds to Essence of Extreme Rush; Slugger corresponds to Essence of Extreme Beast; and Mad Dog of Shimano corresponds to Essence of Extreme Dragon. However, for the story encounters, it is always Extreme Beast in the batting center, and in Shangri-La, it is always Extreme Rush.

In both his penultimate and final fight before Majima Everywhere is complete, he will use Mad Dog with 4 and 6 health bars respectively, and will also perform the QTE attacks in the final fight.

Majima does not use any of the counters from any of his styles.

## Yakuza Kiwami 2

Majima's fighting style is hisYakuza 0Mad Dog moveset, sans his Demonfire counter and Chomp. When playing as him, he regains the counter, but lacks other Mad Dog techniques such as Shadow Trail. His Heat Actions also remain limited; the only ones available to him are the one that normally appears for regular knives the moment they are brandished (which is always available to him instead), and Essence of The Mad Dog: Maul. Like in0, he cannot pick up any items or weapons on the ground, and cannot use any soda machines and their drinks.

## Yakuza: Like a Dragon

For the turn basedYakuza: Like a Dragon, Majima once again uses hisYakuza 0Mad Dog style for the vast majority of his attacks and skills. Majima heavily resists Slash and Firearm damage, and is weak to Fire and non-elemental Magic damage.

- His default attack is the 1st Rush Combo finisher.
- Evasive Slash (エスケープ斬り) is the 2nd Rush Combo finisher.
- Spin Kick Slash (スピンキック斬り) is the 3rd Rush Combo finisher.
- Reverse Kick Slash (ターンキック斬り) is the 4th Rush Combo finisher. The first two hits can launch party members, making the 3rd hit unblockable if not defended properly.
- Tornado Slash (トルネード斬り) is Mad Dog Trick: Frenzy, which can hit multiple party members.

All attacks can potentially inflict Bleed, while the skills can potentially also inflict Paralysis.

Majima gains additional skills at varying health thresholds:

- At 75% health, he uses Doppelganger (分身) which summons 3 shadow doppelgangers that resist Fire instead and have no resistance to Slash or Firearm damage.
- At 50% health, he will perform Hannya's Spirit (般若の気炎), which temporarily raises his evasion by 30% and his attack by 10%, and gives him a bright purple aura. Saejima will also join the battle.
- When Saejima and Majima are both at half health and Saejima is buffed by Tiger's Spirit, Saejima gains access to the skill "Blade Kill" (剛刃合殺), in which Saejima spins a dagger-brandishing Majima in a circle before tossing him at Kasuga, before Majima bounces off a wall and the two make contact with bludgeoning attacks. Majima appears to damage the rest of Kasuga's party but only Kasuga takes any damage from the skill.

All of these skills must be done before Majima can be defeated.

Once defeated, Majima can be summoned through thePoundmatessystem, using Demonfire Rain. Majima will look down from a building and run down its walls towards the enemies, throwing many electricity-induced tantōs at them that summon a torrent of lightning before making one final electric slash. This attack hits all enemies and has a chance to inflict Paralysis. The Majima Thought Entity summoned byShin Amoncan also use this attack against Kasuga and his party once it is under half health.

His Heat aura is purple, and his attack trails have black shadows as they did inYakuza 0.

## Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name

Majima retains his Mad Dog style fromYakuza Kiwami 2, but he is now unable to use Heat Actions at all, much like the other combatants in the Arena (aside from Kiryu). Though he does not have access to his Mad Dog Counter or his quickstep strikes, his boss AI and partner AI uses them. His special Job Action is the long version of Mad Dog Trick: Frenzy fromYakuza 4, and it is unblockable.

His aura is yellow, but as a boss, it is purple.

## Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth

As inYakuza: Like a Dragon, Majima once again uses hisYakuza 0Mad Dog style for all of his attacks and skills except for Cruelty Kick, which is from his Thug style. Majima now resists Electric elemental damage, and is weak to Fire elemental damage.

- His default attack is his 1st Rush Combo finisher.
- Hannya's Spirit, which is his taunt. It heavily buffs his evasion, and has lost the ability to buff his attack, though this is partially due to Majima's increased damage stat in this game. A fiery image of his tattoo appears when he uses this move.
- Rising Slash, which is his full rush combo. Majima's boss AI tends to favor this move, and his doppelgangers do not appear to be able to perform it.
- Evasive Slash, which is his 2nd Rush Combo finisher. Uniquely, Majima can only perform this move through the use of his doppelgangers, or as an AI partner.
- Spin Kick Slash, which is his 3rd Rush Combo finisher.
- Reverse Kick Slash, which is his 4th Rush Combo finisher. The first two hits can launch party members, making the 3rd hit unblockable if not defended properly. Uniquely, Majima can only perform this move through the use of his doppelgangers, or as an AI partner.
- Tornado Slash, which is Mad Dog Trick: Frenzy, which can hit multiple party members. Uniquely, Majima can only perform this move through the use of his doppelgangers, or as an AI partner.
- Cruelty Kick, which is the sideways variation of Thug Cunning: Evasion Strike. Majima tends to use this move more often if the party member targeted is nearby Saejima or Daigo, as it easily sets up into combo hits.
- Doppelganger, which is his doppelganger summon fromYakuza 5. It now summons two doppelgangers instead of three. Majima's partner AI cannot use this move.
- Hannya's Fury, which is his own version of Kiryu's Dragon's Resurgence. Majima can only use this move when he reaches 1% of his health. During it, he has access to all of his moves except for Tornado Slash, Hannya's Spirit, Doppelganger, and Cruelty Kick.

All attacks except for Cruelty Kick can potentially inflict Bleed, while his skills can potentially also inflict Paralysis.

Majima can also follow up and do combo attacks with Saejima and Daigo, similarly to how Kiryu's own party can. His combo attack is Mad Dog Trick: Chomp. As an AI partner, he has access to all of his moves except for Hannya's Fury and Doppelganger.

His Thought Entity during The Big Swell is now blue, rather than purple. It also uniquely is one of the only enemies in the game capable of having a level higher than 99.

His Heat aura is purple, and his attack trails have black shadows as they did inYakuza 0.

## Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii

Majima has two styles here.

Mad Dog(狂犬), which is a mix of his Yakuza 0 Thug style and his regular Mad Dog Style. In the Mad Dog style, Majima primarily uses his fists and a knife for combat. Compared to Kazuma Kiryu, Majima’s movements are noticeably quicker, with agile footwork and rapid attacks. A standout feature in this game is the ability to jump, allowing Majima to perform air combos. Players can enjoy the satisfaction of launching enemies into the air and continuing their attacks mid-air. The extended airtime makes it easy to execute aerial combos for those unfamiliar with action games.

His starting stance is Thug style, if his dagger is out, he'll assume Mad Dog stance.

Additionally, as time passes or when Heat Actions are activated, the Madness Gauge in the top left corner of the screen fills up, allowing Majima to create clones. Once triggered, four shadowy duplicates of Majima appear and begin attacking nearby enemies. They will also sync up with Majima whenever he uses a charge move or his Mid-air knife throw. You cannot switch styles while the clones are active.

The finishers, however, consist of a full clockwise spin followed by an upward slash, a thrust to the face, a clockwise spin jump followed by a downward slash, Mad Dog's fourth Rush Combo attack, and Thug's second finisher, used to launch enemies. He can follow this by jumping up to the airborne opponent.

Sea Dog(パイレーツ,Pairētsu, "Pirates") style focuses on attacks using pirate-themed weapons. Majima can dual-wield cutlasses to slash enemies and even throw them like boomerangs. The Charge Gun increases in power the longer the button is held, and there’s also the option to use wire hooks. This allows Majima to either attack from a distance or quickly close the gap with enemies, offering versatile combat strategies depending on the situation. Uniquely in this style, he can block attacks from all directions.

His starting stance is similar to Slugger's, holding one sword the way he used to hold his bat behind his head, however it's in his left hand. The second sword in his right faces down. When Majima throws his cutlasses, his unarmed finishers use Thug style. One of the moves from breaker returns when you grab after throwing your cutlasses.

When progressing through the Legend of the Goro Pirates side story, Majima will gain access to cursed instruments that summon manifestations of dark gods, he can only use these instruments when his Madness Gauge is full.

In certain battle sequences, he will fight like a modified epee fencer.

Majima can quickstep twice in this style.
