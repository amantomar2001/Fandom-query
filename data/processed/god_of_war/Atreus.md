## Personality

| “ | You have to stop. You can choose to be better. | ” |
| –Atreus before killing Odin |

–Atreus before killing Odin

Atreus is a happy and curious child who is kind to others when he engages in conversation with them, believing that he should help people whether they be living or dead. He is fond of exploring and learning Norse mythology, particularly from Mimir and Freya.

When he was a child, Atreus learned various Norse languages and hunting from his mother. However, his gentle disposition initially made him hesitant to take a life, whether it was an innocent deer or a troll that attacked his father. Despite this, Atreus constantly tries to prove to his father that he can handle himself. It is implied that he feels unwanted by his father and that this sense of rejection is what drives him to become a better warrior. Due to growing up with him, Atreus shows absolutely no fear of Kratos and like his stepmotherLysandra, does not hesitate to call out his father when he needed to. He was also naïve initially, much like his half-sisterCalliope.

Atreus has many flaws stemming from his youth and inexperience but seems to have also inherited some of his father's negative traits, most notably his rage and overconfidence. He attacked the dead body of a Troll in a blind rage and was greatly enraged at Modi's incessant provocation. When Atreus learns about his godhood, it slowly begins to change him due to a misunderstanding of what it means to be a God, in conjunction with his father's desire for him to be better. At this point, he grows cocky and impulsive, becoming rude to Sindri and telling him to shut up about his rivalry with his brother as he considered it a petty problem and telling Mimir to be quiet after the latter comments on his new change of attitude. He also often charges recklessly into battle without hesitation. Soon he has no problem taking a life, such as when he kills Modi, believing that being a god gives him the right to do anything he wants. It also makes him very careless in battle; this is evident during a fight with Baldur: Atreus disobeys his father's orders to stand back, eventually causing the two to be teleported to Hel. After being reprimanded by Kratos for his behavior, Atreus returns to his former personality for the most part. After witnessing Baldur's attempt to kill his own mother and learning the truth about Kratos' past, Atreus becomes much more humble. He is repulsed by the idea of the cycle of patricide after having learned of his grandfather Zeus' death at the hands of Kratos. Upon defeating Baldur, Atreus even reminded him that Baldur was beaten and no longer a threat, advice that he had arrogantly failed to heed earlier.

Despite learning about his godhood, he still retains his childlike qualities. He also retains his compassion, as seen when he tries to protect Kratos during the final battle against Baldur. Another thing of note is his continued devotion to his father. Atreus didn't seem disturbed or put off by his father's admission of killing one of his own family, and perhaps saw this as his father finally opening up to him. Atreus continued to be by his side as they spread the ashes of his mother and continued to talk to him.

Atreus has also shown to care quite a lot for Midgard, certainly more so than Kratos, as after realizing the importance of having the Valkyries restored due to them being the ones who keep the dead from overrunning Midgard, he quickly agreed whereas Kratos did not care that the imprisonment of the Valkyries means that Helheim will overflow with the souls of the dead.

Three years after Fimbulwinter begins, Atreus has displayed significant mental and emotional growth. He has made great strides in controlling his temper and no longer lashes out as he did before. He is largely unaffected by Heimdall’s insults and name-calling, though he was angered when called a "half-breed" (a reference to his mixed God and Giant heritage), though he still expresses anger when Grýla taunted him about his prophesied future, and when a drunken Thor refused to listen to him and called him “Boy”, rather than by his name. However, he has also become a typical teenager, no longer wanting to just simply follow his father's lead and follow his decisions. Atreus has also become more independent and is obsessed with figuring out who he is as an individual outside of his father, and expresses a lot of confusion and uncertainty on the matter. After having learned of his other identity of Loki, he feels that he should embrace that moniker and fulfill the prophecy the Giants had made of him, believing it is who he must become but has no idea what that entails. This results in him becoming more impulsive & making some questionable decisions, lying to his father and having Sindri help him search for Týr behind Kratos' back. He continues to lie and make reckless decisions behind his father's back, such as visiting Freya to convince her to help them stop Odin, which nearly got him killed. After going to Ironwood and learning of the prophecy foretelling his father's death and service to Odin, he becomes desperate to try and avert this fate. Not helping matters is that he has become somewhat overconfident, deciding to go visit Odin, believing he can trick the All-Father despite everyone around him explaining that Odin wasn't to be trusted and was the master of tricks, lies and manipulation. He would finally be humbled when he freesGarm, opening the Nine Realms up to disaster and causing Hel-Walkers to appear everywhere, though he genuinely expresses regret of having "killed" Garm, likely due to his attachment to wolves. However, Kratos expresses that throughout their journey, Atreus had grown into a warrior worthy of his namesake despite his flaws.

Still, it does not mean he is invulnerable to trauma, as he witnessed Brok's death up close by a disguised Odin posing as Týr whom Atreus and Kratos rescued earlier from Svartalfheim. Having lost a valuable member of his family prompted Atreus to go hunting with his father, wanting to get away from the pain and memory as he was the one who decided to look for Týr in the first place and was fooled all this time by Odin. Not to mention that because he invited Odin into Sindri's home, the close friendship between them was ultimately shattered thanks to Brok's death.

–Loki toAngrboda

Atreus(Greek:Ἀτρεύς) /Loki(Nordic:ᛚᛟᚲᛁ) also known asLoki Laufeyson(Translation:Loki, son of Laufey), is the NorseGod of Mischiefand theChampion of the Jötnar. He is the deuteragonist ofGod of War(2018)and one of the two protagonists ofGod of War Ragnarökalong withKratos.

Introduced as the son ofKratosandFaye, Atreus joins his father on a journey to spread his deceased mother's ashes on top of the highest peak in all the Nine Realms. On their journey, Kratos teaches Atreus how to survive and fight as a warrior while Atreus teaches Kratos to open up to those that can help them.

As Atreus and Kratos reachJötunheimto spread Faye's ashes on the Giant Finger's mountain, they learn that she was aJötunn. As Atreus wonders about his heritage, he also learns that his mother gave him the birth name Loki.

DuringFimbulwinter, Atreus seeks answers about his Jötunn heritage, something Kratos cannot answer. This makes Atreus secretly partner up with Sindri to reexamine theJötnar shrines, where they learn that aGod of WarandChampionwill be of great importance during Ragnarök. As Kratos finds out about Atreus' secret activities, he reluctantly agrees to help him, hoping to preventRagnarök.

After Atreus reconciles with his father, he manages to infiltrate Asgard and stealOdin's most prized possession, amaskwith infinite knowledge. AtSindri’s house, it is revealed thatTýrhave been Odin in disguise and killsBrok. As the group manages to drive Odin away and retrieve the mask, they decide to start Ragnarök in order to bring Odin to justice for his crimes against the Nine Realms.

Atreus, Kratos, Freya, and Mimir have a final battle with Odin, resulting in Atreus killing Odin by extracting his soul, who  is then denied an afterlife by a vengefulSindriwho destroys his soul in revenge for Brok's demise. As Fimbulwinter ends, Atreus makes his way through the survivors to tellAngrbodaand his father that he is going explore the lands outside of the Nine Realms, hoping to find the rest of the Giants. With Kratos' acceptance of his son's birthright, Loki would thus leave for his next adventure.

## Quick Answers

## Norse Mythology

Loki is the willy trickster God who is neither good nor evil as he both helps and causes problems across the Nine Realms. Loki's mischiefs varies from loony antics to prophesied apocalypses as he is the main reason for starting Ragnarök.

Very little is known about Loki, while his appearance is only mentioned of being handsome, it is believed that Loki is part Jötunn and part God, but not of Æsir nor Vanir origin. He is also the only Norse figure that presents himself with a matronymic surname, Laufeyson. Being the son of Laufey implies that Loki's father is the Giant, Fárbauti, and his siblings are Helblindi and Býleistr. One day, Loki met the female Jötunn, Angrboða in the Ironwoods and together they had three children: the Giant wolf Fenrir, the World Serpent Jörmungandr and the half-dead/half-living Goddess, Hel. Eventually, Loki would later marry the Goddess Sigyn, and together, they had two sons named Váli and Narfi.

While the exact circumstances of Loki meeting Odin is unknown, it most likely happened while the latter wandered across the Nine Realms. The two Gods formed a strong bond with one another as they mixed their blood together in an oath of loyalty, making them blood-brothers. After this event, Loki journeyed back to Asgard with Odin and formed a close comradeship with another Æsir God, Thor, who he would journey together with on many legendary adventures. In Asgard, Loki had a very mixed reputation. Not only were many Gods jealous of Loki's close bond with Odin and Thor, but also of him being naturally gifted in his magical abilities of shapeshifting, artifice and machiavellian intelligence which made him able to solve numerous problems that no other God could.

Eventually, Loki had a falling out with the Norse Gods when he orchestrated Höðr killing Baldr with a mistletoe arrow. As he had a flyting with the Gods, he publicly told each and every Æsir and Vanir of their most immoral, embarrassing sins proving that they were as bad (if not worse) as he was. Angered by Loki, the Norse Gods decided to punish him for the death of Baldr which led to Loki fleeing and hiding in Midgard before he eventually was captured near the lake, Franangrsfors in the form of a salmon. Loki was thus bound by a Serpent who dripped poison into his eyes causing him to writhe and create earthquakes. As Loki was eventually able to break free from his bonds, he sided with the forces of the Jötnar, started Ragnarök which resulted in Loki fighting Heimdallr and the two killing one another.

In hindsight, Loki is shrouded in mystery as nothing is ever certain about him which has lead to scholars debating about him for centuries with no clear answers. Some believe that Sigyn, Váli and Narfi are respectively the same deities as Angrboða, Fenrir and Jörmungandr since Váli was transformed into a wolf, and Narfi was transformed into a venomous serpent from his entrails. Some suggest that Loki survived Ragnarök as he might have faked his own death, and have many other undocumented abilities he might have kept hidden when he travelled across, between and beyond the Nine Realms.

## In theGod of WarSeries

Born in theWildwoodsofMidgard, Loki, later named Atreus was conceived between the Greek God, Kratos and the Jötunn, Faye. Unbeknownst of his true heritage, Atreus spent most of his childhood as a sickly child and was taken care of by his mother while his father was absent for long periods of time to hunt food. In reality, Kratos was gone so he could learn to control his rage.

As Atreus grew older, he slowly grew healthy enough to walk. However, his sickness still occurred with heavy coughs whenever he got overwhelmed with emotions; worst-case scenario, Atreus would pass out and ended up being sick for days. Faye would later teach him the Norse languages, how to track and hunt for animals, and tell him Norse stories.

At the age of six, Faye decides to teach Atreus how to write down his stories as he moves through life, with the first two years being his practice journal. After two successful years, Atreus and Faye celebrated by burning his practice pages so he can then begin writing his real journals.

One night, Kratos returns home much earlier than usual, having been gone less than a day. Atreus compliments his father for having been able to win in a fight against wolves with his bare hands. Kratos immediately scolds Atreus and tells him that while he won the fight, he lost the only battle that truly mattered to him.

The next day, Faye tells Atreus that she will be out hunting and will return before nightfall. Before Kratos leaves, he scolds Atreus playing with his wooden figures instead of chopping firewood. Later that day when Kratos returns home, he is followed by Beast-Men who blame Kratos for killing their brother. As they engage in combat, the Beast-Men reveal themselves to be shapeshifters as they transform into bears. After Kratos kills the group, the leader proclaims that he will return with the rest of the clan to take revenge at him and to avenge one of his fallen brothers.

Knowing that their home isn't safe until the threat had been dealt with, Kratos decides to take Atreus with him as they hunt down the leader. As Kratos loses his trail, Atreus further suggests that they could visit the old seer down the valley, who Faye sometimes visits to help them. With no other option, Kratos agrees and Atreus guides them to the seer. While arriving on time at her hut, the seer tells them that the Beast-Men are able to shapeshift themselves thanks to a bear-totem and she also hinted the clan is currently occupied in the Longhouse. Kratos then decides to make the journey by walking himself alone, while leaving Atreus behind with the seer, believing that he is not ready yet.

The elderly seer tells Atreus that his father has successfully killed the Beast-Men and has taken away most of their own shapeshifting abilities by destroying the bear-totem. She then hands Atreus a knife and tells him that he must do something before Kratos returns to them. Suddenly, the Beast-Men leader appears and kills the seer while Atreus is able to defend himself. As the seer dies, Kratos and Atreus make her a funeral pyre. As they walk home, Kratos compliments Atreus' defense but says he is still not ready to fight yet.

One day, Faye tells Atreus that an oldfriendof hers taught her how to craft a long bow, and she will now pass the knowledge onto Atreus to make one. As Faye finishes the bow, Atreus bestows it with the name asTalon Bow. Because of this, it eventually became one of his first official weapon and he immediately starts practicing together with his mother. As his father returns to their home, he tests the bowstring without firing it, much to Atreus' confusion. Later, Kratos compliments the weapon, making Atreus happy of finally having received his father's attention without being scolded.

As Atreus practices with his bow and runic charms, he starts to develop abilities and magic he cannot explain such as extrasensory perception, telepathic readings, and understanding the feelings of animals. When Faye learns all about this, she appears to be pleased with his son.

During a normal day, Atreus cides to test his telepathic abilities and hears an animal voice cry out in pain. Despite his mother warning him of not wandering too far out to the woods, Atreus grabs his bow and pack his arrows. Therefore, he sets forth on his first adventure where he hears a mysterious cry of a pained animal asking for help . As he continues forth, passing a tree with a yellow hand print that is adorned to its bark, he suddenly finds himself lost in an unfamiliar terrain. Atreus eventually finds the animal which is a large doe on the ground with an arrow stuck in its own neck. He eventually calms down, comforts the doe, and eases her passing by reciting Norse death rites. To Atreus' surprise, he finds the corpse of the doe’s hunter who is sadly dismembered in pieces.

As Atreus panics, he eventually finds the ones responsible for the carnage, two draugrs, which engage him in combat. As Atreus even manages to kill one of the draugrs, the other one sliced his arm. In pain, Atreus begins to feel a blinding rage come over which makes him pass out, right before he sees his father easily kill the remaining draugr. Atreus then awakens to find himself being carried by Kratos while running at unimaginable speeds. Atreus feels his arm wound, as Kratos scolds him and tells Atreus to guide them at home.

One night, Atreus noticed that his mother was unusually quiet. As he tried to use his telepathic ability, he noticed she was sad. As she noticed Atreus was reading her mind, she turned happy again and told him another Norse story with a tired voice. For next past months, Atreus notices that Kratos and Faye have switched roles with his father staying at home and cooking food while his mother leaves them for days at a time. It is later revealed that Faye is terminally ill and is going to die soon.

## God of War(2018)

After his mother's death, Atreus encounters his father, who was chopping down a tree which Faye marked. Atreus helps his father prepare his mother's body for cremation and takes his mother's knife. While they wait for her body to completely burn to ashes, Kratos orders Atreus to hunt deer in order to see whether he has the skills to survive the journey to fulfill his mother's dying wish; to scatter her ashes at the highest peak in all the realms. They track and find a deer, but Atreus shoots too hastily and fails to kill the deer in a single shot, which earns him a scolding from Kratos. They eventually find the deer and Atreus manages to incapacitate it, but is shocked when Kratos orders him to deliver the killing blow as he had never killed something before. With his father's assistance, Atreus stabs the deer in the throat. Unfortunately, their success was short-lived as atrollattacks them. Faced with danger, Atreus assists his father with his archery in the ensuing fight and both of them successfully kill the troll. However, Atreus loses control of his rage and continues attacking the corpse, only stopping after Kratos brings him back to his senses. Because of this, Kratos declares the boy not ready for the journey, much to his disappointment and they head back home.

However, astrangerarrives at their doorstep soon after they head home. Kratos orders Atreus to hide in the basement while he confronts the stranger. After Kratos fights and wins against the stranger, he heads back to the house and orders Atreus to prepare for the journey, declaring their home no longer safe. As they journey towards the highest mountain in the land, Atreus notices that their home was surrounded by a magical grove of trees which was broken when Kratos cut down a tree from the said magical grove, breaking the protection it provided.

The boy and his father began a quest to take his mother's ashes to the highest peak of the Nordic Realm, which they assume to be the highest mountain visible to them. Along the way they encounter many monsters such asdraugr,hel-walkers, andrevenants. They also encounterBrok, a blue dwarven blacksmith who claims to have made Atreus'mother's axeand offers them merchant and/or smithing services. Sometime later on the journey, they encounter a boar. This time Atreus lands a critical blow to the animal, but is caught up in the thrill of the chase and follows the boar, leaving his father behind. He eventually catches up to the boar being tended to by awitchwho says the boar is her friend. They follow the witch to her home and help her heal the boar. In return, the witch leads them through a secret passage from her home, assigns them with a mark to hide them from 'people who would disrupt their journey' and a compass which leads them to their set goal.

Atreus and Kratos leave the witch's home and take a boat. Eventually, they arrived at a lake, while the boy identified the stranger as Baldur. They find a submerged statue in the middle of the lake with a writing in the middle of the water, telling them to "throw their arms to the lake." When Kratos complies and throws the Leviathan into the lake, they inadvertently summonJörmungandr, the World Serpent, whose awakening causes the lake to drain and revealed the previously submerged structure, the Bifröst, underneath and opening the path for their journey.

Atreus and Kratos continue on foot and encounterSindri,Brok's brother who is also a blacksmith and opens his shop to them as well. They begin to climb the mountain only to find the path blocked by a dark magic called the 'Black Breath'. Unable to pass, the witch arrives and tells them the only way to dispel the magic is by journeying toAlfheimand collecting the Light of Alfheim. They journey back to theBifröstand reactivate the machinery within. With the witch's instruction, the three of them reactivate the Bifröst and journey together to Alfheim. However, they find the Light has dwindled. To make matters worse, the spell which prevents the witch from travelling through realms takes effect and she is pulled back into Midgard, leaving Atreus and his father to fend for themselves in the foreign realm.

Kratos and Atreus in Alfheim

Atreus and Kratos journey deeper into Alfheim and get caught up in an ongoing war between its inhabitants, the dark elves and the light elves. The former, being the dominating faction, immediately regard the two visitors as hostile and attack them through their journey. The pair battle through these hostile elves and other monsters, eventually making their way to the temple and the Light of Alfheim housed within. Kratos goes inside the Light and leaves Atreus with his axe to wait. However, Kratos fails to come out after a long period of time, leaving Atreus to fend for himself against hordes of dark elves with his bow and the axe. A frustrated and worried Atreus eventually pulled his father out of the Light. Kratos, who was unaware of how much time had passed inside the Light, reprimands Atreus for pulling him out, causing the boy to snap back at his father for abandoning him fending for himself against a force of Dark Elves alongside a leviathan axe he wielded. With the Light collected, Kratos imbues Atreus' bow with the Light, allowing the boy to create bridges made of light by shooting Light-imbued arrows to light crystals. The newfound power helps the pair get out of the temple and after fighting and killing the dark elf leader,Svartáljǫfurr, make their way through the Bifröst. However, Atreus' frustration with his father's seeming lack of empathy causes him to accuse Kratos of not caring about Faye. Kratos is immediately angered at the accusation and tells the boy to leave him to mourn in his own way. Realizing that his father felt grief for his mother, Atreus immediately apologized. Kratos showed his understanding and admitted it has not been easy for his son as well and the two reconciled.

With the Light of Alfheim in their possession, the pair make their way back to Midgard and the blocked passage. They use the Light to dispel the black breath and enter the mines within. They reactivate the elevator mechanism within, but on their ascent are interrupted by a variety of creatures and finally,Hræzlyr, adragonthat resides within the mines. They fend off the dragon and get out of the mines but find the dragon on the verge of eating Sindri. Not wanting the dwarf to die, Atreus momentarily distracts the dragon while Kratos moves to attack it. While Kratos fights the dragon, Atreus rescues Sindri and leads him to safety but is soon noticed by the dragon. It lunges at them, leaving Atreus in a nearby crane mechanism. Atreus then wait for Kratos' command to shoot down the crane, which Kratos uses to impale the dragon into a crystal of hardened world tree sap, killing it. A grateful Sindri then gives Atreus mistletoe arrows and imbues his bow with the dead dragon's lightning in gratitude.

Kratos allows Atreus to help Sindri in order for him to attack

As they neared the summit, Kratos noticed that Atreus' quiver strap was loose and used a piece of mistletoe to fasten it. Climbing towards the peak, they heard voices up above. It was the stranger, whom Atreus earlier identified as theAesirGod Baldur, and his nephewsMagniandModiquestioning a man in the tree for Kratos' whereabouts, now aware that he's traveling with a child, but the latter couldn't answer due to the Witch's mark concealing them. After the Aesir had departed, father and son ascended the summit, meeting the man in the tree, who introduced himself asMimir, self-proclaimed smartest man alive. Despite his own self-assurance that they were alone, Atreus reluctantly followed his father's orders to check if the Aesir had doubled back. Subsequently, they explained their objective to Mimir, who informed them that the true highest peak in all the realms was inJötunheim, to Atreus' frustration. To prove his point, Mimir showed them a projection of their destination in the only Jötunn portal. Mimir offered to help father and son reach Jötunheim. However, as Odin had made his wooden prison invulnerable even toMjölnir, Mimir requested Kratos behead him; Atreus attempted to prove him wrong by cutting at the tree with his knife to no avail. He then averted his eyes before his father did the deed.

They then take Mimir's head back to the Witch to reanimate it. However, the Witch became alarmed upon seeing the mistletoe arms in Atreus' quiver and ordered him to surrender them. Atreus reluctantly conceded at this father's command. The Witch then destroyed the arrows, calling them "wicked", and made Atreus promise to destroy any more mistletoe he should come across, before giving him her arrows as compensation. After reanimating Mimir's head, Atreus was surprised when the Witch spat in his face and the head identifying her asFreya, the former Queen of theVanir. His father was angry that the goddess didn't identify herself earlier and told Atreus they had to depart without even thanking her.

Now that they have their guide Kratos demands information on Baldur and how to defeat him when they run into him again, to which Mimir claims that Baldur is invulnerable to any threat physical or magical. Instead the father-son duo asks for the information they had agreed on, how to enter Jötunheim. The trio travel back to the Bifröst to consult the World Serpent according to whom they need three things, the chisel of a Giant, the travel rune for Jötunheim, and the gate they found next to Mimir's prison, and Mimir knows where they can get a chisel.

The duo reaches the corpse of Thamur, but realize that the ice is too thick to break through, so they climb to the top of the hammer and release it from its chains. After a while, they reach the chisel, only for the path to be blocked by Magni, who demands them to surrender. Kratos tells Atreus to flee but is intercepted by Modi. During the violent, bloody struggle, Modi decides to use this time to taunt Atreus about his mother causing Atreus to lose his senses and attack. Luckily, Kratos kills Magni, while Modi flees, with Atreus yelling at him to come back and fight him. Unfortunately, his anger triggers the return of his illness.

Atreus uses his Spartan Rage for the first time

Later, as father and son return to Týr's Temple to retrieve the travel rune, Modi ambushes them and pins Kratos down with lightning, saying that he'll only earn his father's hammer by default and how he ruined everything. Atreus shouts at him to stop, only to receive another insult about Faye, causing him to charge at the God, but is knocked aside. Modi adds that he'll be his new brother soon. Atreus activates his Spartan Rage but falls into a coma. After Kratos beats Modi, Mimir suggests he take him to Freya, which he does. She lets him in and says that Kratos will need to find the heart ofMattugr Helson, the Bridge Keeper, but tells him that his axe will be useless, so he rushes home to dust off hisBlades of Chaos.

After Kratos returns fromHelheim, Atreus recovers and continues their quest. When he is asked, of why he's quiet, Atreus responds that he overheard his father call him cursed and regretted that he was 'not what his father wanted' and for his curse. Kratos tells him that he is a God, which astonishes him, and Kratos explains that the curse is a lifetime of misery and trauma. When he asks if he can turn into a wolf, Kratos says that he is welcome to surprise him. When Atreus questions why he is not like his father, Mimir explains that all gods are different, pointing out Atreus' supernatural skill with language as one of his abilities, which Kratos lacks. The duo return to Týr's Temple where Atreus activates the sandbowl which lowers them down to a hallway-like maze full of deadly traps. Atreus and Kratos realize that Týr has traveled across the world learning the culture and art of war in many realms, even Kratos' own.

Atreus starts to become cocky and arrogant over time, like yelling to Sindri about his brother being more talented than him and charging at enemies recklessly. After entering the mountain, Kratos and Atreus encounter a beaten Modi, who explains that his father had beaten him for his cowardice. Atreus threatens him to back off. Modi tries to attack, but is too badly beaten to do so. Against his father's orders, he kills Modi with Kratos explaining about kill ethics. Atreus brushes it off saying that nobody cared about him anyways. When Kratos says there are consequences to killing Gods, Atreus asks how he knows such a thing. Kratos doesn't respond.

An arrogant and cocky Atreus kills a defenseless Modi

After climbing the summit, Kratos activates the portal to Jötunheim, but Baldur ambushes them and after a scuffle where Atreus shoots his father with one of his arrows and tries to attack Baldur head on, the three ends up in the travel room where Baldur has Asgard locked in, but Kratos instead locks in Helheim and the three end up getting sucked in. After Kratos disciplines his son, they continue their journey, along the way, they realize that Freya is Baldur's mother and she cast a spell on him in which it makes him invulnerable, but unable to feel anything.

To return to Týr's Temple, Kratos improvised using pyres to allow a ship to fly. But due to constant attacks from the forces of Hel attempting to stop them, the bow of the ship was torn off just as they reached Týr's Temple. Suddenly, an illusion of Kratos furiously attacking what appeared to be hisfather. Ignoring the vision, Atreus urged his father to jump just as they were over the temple. Kratos quickly deployed his shield to break their fall as they crashed into a previously inaccessible section of the temple; Mimir commented that they were both insane.

Entering the adjoining chambers, which Mimir identifies as Odin's, they find the missing panel about Týr from his vault. As Kratos held Mimir up to the panel, he observed it depicting Týr traveling magically but was confused at why the giants would devote a shrine to him. Atreus then inquired about the four runes in the corners, but Mimir corrected that they were symbols from different lands and Kratos finished they meant war, recognizing the one in the upper right corner. Kratos observed that Týr's eyes were jewels like Mimir's. Upon proximity to Mimir's eye, the panel suddenly illuminated hidden illustrations, revealing secret plans for a key to a secret room that none but Týr and the Giants' confidants could access, indicating there was an alternate path to Jötunheim.

As they descended the elevator back into the Realm Travel Room, Kratos asked Atreus if he saw the illusion of himself with an old man back on the ship, though Atreus claimed to have seen nothing. They then realigned the bridge with Midgard, Kratos questioned Mimir why he never mentioned that Baldur was Freya's son. Mimir stated he felt both surprise as well as awareness of this fact. This prompted Kratos to inquire again about Baldur's weakness, causing Mimir to repeat his denial of such a thing. Kratos told Atreus his suspicion that Freya bewitched Mimir to prevent from speaking of Baldur's weakness. Mimir theorized Freya must have performed this spell when his head was at her mercy or when he deduced Baldur's weakness. Atreus then inquired what that weakness was only be frustrated as Freya's spell took hold of Mimir again. Kratos assured them both that Baldur's weakness does exist, and they had only to find it if they encounter him again.

As they met with Brok and requested he make the key, Brok outright refused because it wasn't a weapon and that his tools would be damaged forging such a delicate object. Suddenly, Sindri shows up and offers his aid. The Huldra brothers then reconcile and forge the key for the trio, branding it with their combined seal. Atreus expressed his joy at their reconciliation.

Using the key at another section of the temple, they find themselves underneath the Realm Travel Room and Kratos spots a light at the Jötunheim door on the ceiling. After circumventing Týr's traps to release the chains holding the Realm Travel Room so Kratos could flip it. Promptly ascending the structure, Atreus tells Mimir the value of teamwork and cooperation, despite their constant bickering, in passing Týr's test. They then reached the mysterious object, which Mimir identified as theUnity Stone. He deduced from the panel in Odin's library that depicted Týr traveling the Realms Between Realms.

Returning to the Realm Between Realms, Atreus climbed atop his father as they leaped off the path of the World Tree. With the Unity Stone protecting them, they find themselves on another branch with the Jötunheim tower at the other side. Entering the tower, Kratos inserted the Unity Stone into a pedestal, causing the tower to release enemies from other realms which they had to fight before finally returning to Midgard.

As they attempt to align the bridge with Jötunheim, Mimir points out that there's no travel crystal to refract the energy, and suspected that Týr used the Bifröst crystals in his own eyes as a final failsafe. Atreus recalled that Mimir had a Bifröst crystal as well but was reminded that he needed his other eye, which Odin plucked to keep him from traveling. However, he suspected that Brok and Sindri might know its hiding place as he had seen them lurking in the mountain when Odin came for his visits. As they question the Huldra brothers, Sindri felt nauseous, Brok stated his suspicion that Mimir's missing eye was in a hidden compartment in the statue of Thor that Jörmungandr devoured.

Summoning the World Serpent, Mimir convinced him to allow them to travel inside his belly to retrieve the eye, much to Atreus' disgust. But once they retrieve the eye, an outside force forces the Serpent to regurgitate them onto the shores near Thamur's corpse. Freya soon arrives, asking what happened to Jörmungandr. Atreus kept his distance from Freya at his father's advice, unsure whether to trust her. Baldur then emerged from the icy waters and blames the father and son for costing him so much. Freya then tried to make amends with her son but he was intent on killing her for cursing him. Kratos chose to intervene, warning Baldur against seeking vengeance. As they begin to fight, Atreus pleaded Freya to flee but she refused, believing she could reason with Baldur. She quickly restrained Kratos with vines but Baldur quickly escaped her grip. Baldur advised Atreus to look away, but he refused to allow his father to come to harm, resulting in the Aesir punching him in the chest. Atreus' vest was covered in blood but he insisted it wasn't his. Baldur's hand had gotten stabbed on the piece of mistletoe Atreus used to fasten his quiver strap, breaking his curse and rendering him vulnerable.

Suddenly, Freya restrains Baldur with vines and reanimates Thamur to grab Kratos and Atreus. Atreus then realized Freya destroyed his mistletoe arrows to avert Baldur's curse being broken. Furthermore, her spell on Mimir had lifted as he confirmed Baldur was vulnerable. They were then released back onto the icy plain where their battle continued before moving onto Thamur's chisel. Atreus shot his arrows repeatedly into Baldur as they leaped from the chisel back onto the ground. Baldur soon gained the upper hand as he grabbed them both by the throat, thanking them for performing what even the All-Father himself could not. Kratos forced Baldur to release them with hisSpartan Rageand continued the fight on a plateau. Freya attempted to stop the fight by having Thamur breathe an icy wind. Suddenly, Atreus summoned Jörmungandr in his own tongue. The World Serpent attacked Thamur, forcing everyone back to the ground where the fight started.

Kratos held Baldur in a chokehold, but Atreus convinced his father that he was beaten and no longer a threat. Kratos warned Baldur not to come after them nor lay a hand on Freya. However, Baldur would not give up on his vengeance and began to strangle Freya. Frantically, Atreus pleaded his father to intervene and so Kratos stated the cycle must end as he snapped Baldur's neck, killing him. Freya swore vengeance against Kratos, much to Atreus' outrage at her lack of gratitude. Freya then coerced Kratos into revealing his past to Atreus. He explained that he was from a place calledSpartaand his path began from pledging himself to aGodthat cost him everything. He killed many who were deserving and others who were not. Eventually, he killed hisfather. Atreus asked if being a God was all about murdering family. Kratos insisted they need to learn to be better. Freya then departed with Baldur's body.

As they made their way back to Týr's Temple, Atreus wondered why Baldur said they cost him so much. Mimir voiced his suspicion that Odin probably convinced Baldur that following them to Jötunheim would bring his cure, of which was certainly a lie. As for the boy's follow-up question regarding why mistletoe harmed Baldur, the head explained that as powerful as Vanir magic is, its rules remain slippery and elusive.

Returning to the Realm Travel Room, Atreus held Mimir's head to refract the energy, finally opening the portal to Jötunheim. Mimir decided to stay behind, believing this to be a family matter and was left with Brok and Sindri. As they crossed into Jötunheim, Kratos entrusted Faye's ashes to Atreus for the remainder of their journey.

They then entered a cave filled with the stone faces of giants. As they reached the exit, suddenly the walls start disintegrating at Atreus' touch, revealing hidden prophecies. The first depicted Faye arguing with the Giants. The others depicted all the events from their journey, indicating that the giants had foreseen their collective story. Kratos corrected this was all to prophesize Atreus' tale. They both came to the conclusion that Faye was in fact a giant, thus making Atreus part-Giant and wonders why his mother never told them the truth. His father suspected that sent them on this journey, knowing they'd find these prophecies and trusted she had good reason. He then concluded that Baldur was tracking Faye the whole time, not knowing she was only ashes. Atreus then chose to put his faith in his mother's plan, whatever it is since she hadn't been wrong once.

Atreus and his father, spreading Faye's ashes

After spreading his mother's ashes with his father, he asked him why he was referred to as "Loki" on the wall drawings they found earlier which depicted their journey. Kratos then told him that his mother wanted to call himLoki,and speculated that this is the name she told the Jötnar. However, Kratos goes on and says he convinced her to let him be named Atreus instead.

Kratos tells his son that his namesake was aSpartan warriorwho, unlike most Spartans, was happy and filled with life. During and after battles, he would fill his fellow Spartans with hope. When he was killed in battle, Kratos himself carried him back to Sparta on his shield and personally buried him. Kratos wanted his son to be named Atreus because he fills him with joy. Atreus was amazed by this account, commenting that his father actually told him a good story.

| “ | Atreus, are you ready?Yeah, but... I had the weirdest dream. Fimbulwinter was ending. And Thor came to us, here at the house.It was only a dream.But it felt different. It felt real... it felt like the future.Then we will worry about it tomorrow. Today, there are still things we can do. Come. | ” |

–Atreus and Kratos about Ragnarök and Thor

After fulfilling Faye's dying wish, Atreus and his father returned home for a well-deserved rest. That night, Atreus seemingly had a dream regarding future events, withFimbulwinterconcluding after a few years andThorappearing at his doorstep, possibly to take revenge on the two for the death of his sons and his half-brother. He told Kratos about this, but the latter told his son that that's something they'll handle another day and that what they do today is what matters.

## Between God of War(2018)& God of War Ragnarök

A year after Baldur's death, Atreus begins writing in his journal once more, chronicling what has happened to the world. He remarks that the snow and ice have gotten worse with each passing day. He notes how he and his father now spends everyday training and gathering for supplies, but hunting has become a lot harder and that he can hear the animals fear about an incoming storm, unlike anything ever seen before.

He notes that both he and Mimir have noticed that Kratos has become despondent, due to the fact that his father knows this winter isn't normal, but a fated sign of things to come and that he cannot do anything about it even with all of his strength as it is completely out of his control. Mimir says that Odin has tried for centuries to fight this fate, but it is a pointless effort and the coming of Ragnarök as it cannot be stopped, by the Aesir or by Kratos. Atreus then asks Mimir whether or not his father could kill Thor, a question that had been plaguing his mind ever since he had the dream of the Thunder God showing up outside their house. Despite noting earlier that his father is the most frightening killer he has ever seen, Mimir replies that he doesn't know who would win.

On another day, Atreus writes how he's killed yet another raven. He notes how he can usually hear an animal's feelings and birds' feelings are as beautiful as the songs they sing, but these ravens were cold and silent inside. Atreus notes that Odin must have cast a shroud over his spies so their feelings could not be heard.

One day, Atreus notices a few wolves outside of their yards open gate. Nocking his bow with lightning arrows, Atreus steps out into the yard and notes that there are six wolves pacing near the gate, raising his bow. Noticing Atreus, the pack of wolves enter the yard and form a half circle around him begin howling at the sky in unison. Atreus notes that upon hearing the howls he felt a strangely familiar buzzing in his head and lowered his bow. The wolves continued to howl for a minute, until Kratos came running up from the river path where he had originally been cleaning the game they had caught earlier that day in preparation for storage, whereupon they quickly ran off and disappeared into the forest. Upon reaching Atreus, Kratos asked if he was alright and giving him a strange look. He replied that he was fine, and Kratos asked if the wolves had attacked him. The question almost made Atreus laugh, as he found the idea of the wolves attacking him to be genuinely funny, but he had no idea why.

Atreus notes that he keeps thinking about why his mother wanted to name him "Loki", as it did not sound like any Jötunn name he had ever heard of. He knows it must mean something important, as his mother never did anything without a good reason.

Another day, Atreus writes how things around them have changed drastically. He can feel that the forest itself is getting ready for something and is afraid. The Lake of Nine has now completely frozen over and Odin has completely blocked access to the travel room in Týr's Temple thereby stopping any sort of realm travel. He notes that Hel-Walkers are acting differently as well and are far more organised. Whenever he and Kratos engage in a fight with them, they fight back for a bit but then deliberately retreat. Atreus does not know whether or not this is because they are waiting for reinforcements or for an order to attack, which frustrates both him and his father. He notes that every day, more crazy things start happening and he doesn't know if he'll be able to keep writing in his journal.

Atreus then asks Laufey for guidance.

## God of War Ragnarök

Atreus is a fourteen year old teenager and has grown taller, towering above Brok and Sindri. He has gained a bulkier build, a deeper voice and his skin is less pale than it was when he was younger. Back in the day, Kratos cut his hair. These days it's mostly Atreus with some help from dad. He holds the Talon Bow on his back with an S-shaped hook patterned afterJörmungandr. He wears a yellow tunic lined with fur, the yellow reflects his strong connection to his mother and the Giants, the red stitching is in the same place as hisfather's tattoo. On his right arm he wears an Elven brass, He continues to wear his father's red sash and mother's yellow scarf. On the cuff of his sleeve he wears a burnished pewter cuff ornament, in addition he wears a leather arm guard, It's wolf themed to represent the speed and aggressiveness of the arrows he shoots, it also protects his arm from getting hit by his bowstring. Atreus also wears hand-engraved bronze hook buckles made byBrok. His boots are made of reindeer hide, according toSindriAtreus had to learn how to make them himself. Additionally, he also wears the mistletoe arrowhead that allowed Baldur to be defeated as a necklace, stating that it makes him feel brave and is a reminder of his father telling him that they need to be better gods.

Atreus now uses an identical knife to his fathers, it is the knife his father made for him when he was born by mixing metals from hishomelandand from theNine realms. In terms of his bow, the style slightly changed overtime, his father made the new arrows with a robust design and construction.

## Appearance

## God of War (2018)

Atreus is an eleven-year-old boy with red hair and a pale face. It is unknown if his skin tone stemmed from his father's curse passing onto him or from his illness. The birthmark on his face is pale resembling the marking his uncle Deimos has, He has light freckling and icy blue eyes. Passed down to him by his mother, Norse runes line Atreus’ arms as well as the right side of his back neck. Atreus has a wolf fur pelt as part of his Tunic of Hope. Underneath, he wears a worn mesh shirt. Also, around his neck, he wears a yellow scarf given to him by his mother and rests it underneath his clothing. Atreus’ quiver strap is held together with hemp and leather that hangs across his left shoulder. Over the waist scarf, Atreus has on a mesh rope that is acting as a belt and also holds hismother’s knife. Underneath his fur and top, Atreus has on a Norse leather skirt that is very worn on the bottom. Over this, he is also wearing a Greek waist scarf given to him by hisfather. Similar to his father, Atreus has leather Norse leg wraps as well as the mesh ropes over his dark shoes.

Atreus’ quiver is made out of leather and light fabric, which his mother taught him to tie together. Decorating it are simple drawings that show off some of Atreus’ childhood. Atreus’ bow is made out of a piece of wood from around his home, tied together by a rope strand. His mother helped create this and taught how to shoot. He added designs to it as inspired by his father with bandages and red paint near the end, Atreus’ arrow is simplistically carved with a sharp metal arrowhead and three feathers equally lining the end. Gifted by Atreus’ Mother, her Knife has a meaning that is sharper in importance than the tip of the blade itself. It empowers him with courage and a growing strength in combat, as he embarks on a very perilous journey with his Father.

## Powers

Likely due to him being a son of the former Olympian God of War and a Frost Giantess, Atreus possesses considerable superhuman physical abilities but due to his age and years of sickness, he is significantly weaker than he should be. After Kratos tells him about his origin, his illness retreats and some of his power gradually appears. It is noteworthy that due to his young age, Atreus has yet to discover the extent of his abilities, as he is noted by Mimir to have great potential thanks to his unique heritage.

- Superhuman Strength: While not up to the extent of his father, Atreus appears to have a decent level of superhuman strength, as he was able to aid his father Kratos in pushing Thamur's Hammer, though how much of the moving Atreus is actually contributing to is unknown. He also apparently has little trouble brandishing theLeviathanAxe, which is almost as large as he is. He was even capable of staggeringBaldurand causing him to bleed. During the battle againstOdin, he was capable of harming the All-Father with his punches and kicks. This strength, however, seems to be irregular as Atreus struggles to lift aPschentstuck on his head in Týr's Temple, although this could be attributed to his sickness making him weaker than he should have been. After three years of training during Fimbulwinter, Atreus has grown stronger but was no match for Aesir gods or stronger beings; neither was he able to pull out Thrúd’s sword from the floor when she planted it there. His strength, however, increases by many orders of magnitude while in bear form; he proved quite a challenge for his own father, and later was able to overpower and kill a Valkyrie.
- Superhuman Durability: Atreus, apparently inherited from his father and mother's status as among the most powerful of their species, has considerable superhuman durability and resilience. Hence, he can easily withstand attacks and falls from great distances with little to no damage. He also survived a powerful punch fromBaldurwithout any lasting damage during the last battle against him. While apparently not able to tolerate the extreme environments as well as his father considering his repeated complaints, Atreus is shown able to survive in Hel and Muspelheim without suffering any visible harm.
- Superhuman Agility: Unlike his other abilities which are inferior in comparison to his father, Atreus is shown to be on par with Kratos in terms of agility as he has been shown leaping great distances and falling from up high with seemingly little to no discomfort. He also makes great use of his agility in combat.
- Superhuman Stamina: While not as great like his father, Atreus has tremendous stamina for his age and is able to run long distances through the forest and participate in long battles while showing no signs of fatigue. Most remarkably, he was capable of fighting against several elves by himself in Alfheim for an extended period of time while Kratos was stuck in the Light.
- Superhuman Senses: He states on many occasions that he can sense other beings and their thoughts and emotions, including their power, and can hear voices because of this ability. Atreus also notices the change around their home when Kratos cutting the marked trees.
- Regenerative Healing Factor: Atreus also has a regenerative healing factor, albeit much less powerful than his father's regenerative abilities due to his young age. Upon pulling the knife Baldur impaled on his right arm, he quickly healed with no signs of injury. When injured in his fight against his father when he first transformed into a bear, Atreus was able to focus to consciously heal his injuries when guided by his father.
- Immortality: As with all Gods, Atreus is immortal and cannot be killed by anything not powerful enough.

- Enhanced Intelligence: For someone his age, Atreus already displays a very high level of intelligence, wisdom and understanding. Even Freya commented on Atreus' wisdom and higher intelligence, despite being so young. Given his young age, his already impressive intelligence has yet to fully develop and mature.Linguistic Abilities: In addition to the languages taught to him by his mother, Atreus has an almost supernatural talent to understand written and spoken languages he has never heard of or read before by tracing their connections. He explains it to Kratos as he may only be actually able to read a few words and letters but is usually enough to get what the sentence is trying to say. With language ciphers, Atreus can quickly learn how to read the Niflheim and Muspelheim languages. Given an amphora of Lemnian wine from Kratos' homeland, Atreus was able to learn how to read some of the words in Greek. Even Mimir, the smartest man in the Nine Realms, takes note of Atreus' linguistic capabilities for someone of his age.Zoolingualism: He can even understand some animals, as he understood whatBrok's beast-of-burden was feeling and could hear the giant turtle above Freya's house and understand that his name was Chaurli.Native Languages: He could understand the native language spoken by the Dwarves and Dark Elves.Soul Language: He was also able to understand a soul that had trapped itself inside of a magical ring, who had placed himself there to escape from a soul eater. He can even use this to emotionally communicate with animals.Dead Languages: He was able to put together a sentence in the dead language of the World Serpent despite only hearing it a handful of times and later fully learned it. He was even able to read the language on the Mask, something which even Odin could not do.Photographic Memory: He has also shown an eidetic memory, being able to take one glance at a very complex rune and instantaneously memorize it without forgetting it.

- Photographic Memory: He has also shown an eidetic memory, being able to take one glance at a very complex rune and instantaneously memorize it without forgetting it.
- Spartan Rage/Shapeshifting: Atreus attempted to use Spartan Rage whenModitried to kill his father and mocked his mother, but due to his lack of experience and physical prowess, he collapses soon after from the stress. During the events ofGod of War Ragnarök, Atreus discovers that he can assume the forms of certain animals as manifestations of his rage, including (but not necessarily limited to) a wolf and a monstrous bear. While transformed, he becomes much more aggressive and gains tremendous strength, able to easily decimate smaller foes and contend with formidable, powerful opponents -- including Valkyries, high-ranking Einherjar and his own father.
- Precognition: Possibly due to his Jötunn heritage, he was able to experience subjective precognitive dreams of the future. Before he realized that he was a half-Jötunn, he mentioned that he dreamt of being eaten while in the belly ofJörmungandr. After his mother's quest and his heritage is revealed, Atreus has a prophetic dream about the future, whenFimbulwinteris ending andThorshows up in front of their house. This ability may continue to grow in the future in the form of the God of Stories.
- Spell Casting: With his ability for ancient languages, Atreus can use magical enchantments. In response, his runic tattoos will emanate a yellow glow.Bow Abilities: Using his bow, he can shoot a stronger version of his arrow shoots.Spiritual Summoning: He can cast a spell which allows him to summon spirit helpers to help him fight.Soul Manipulation: Due to his half-Jötunn heritage, Atreus also has the ability to manipulate souls to a certain extent. He can even extract the souls of living beings and transfer them into another body or store them in an object. He was able to unknowingly put Fenrir's soul into his knife, which he then put into the body of Garm. He also used this ability to extract Odin's soul and place it in a Jötunn Marble, effectively incapacitating him.

## Abilities

- Adept Combatant: While not as powerful or experienced as his father, Atreus is a fairly skilled combatant in his own right. Throughout their journey, Atreus proves to be a quick learner as his skills advance considerably compared to when they started (depending on the player's upgrades). He is able to take advantage of his small size and combine his archery skills with acrobatic feats such as incapacitating Draugr by climbing on them and choking them with his bow to give Kratos an opening or firing arrows in mid-air. When Kratos left him alone to collect the Light, he was able to kill off waves of Dark Elves by himself before he decides to rescue his father. In combat, Atreus effectively acts as a support and an extension of Kratos, allowing the pair to combine their combat styles into a synchronized offense. The most impressive display of this teamwork is during the final fight with Baldur, where Atreus helps his father take down the powerful God with a combination of archery, acrobatics, and melee combat. Three years later during the events ofFimbulwinter, Atreus has developed even further as a fighter. He is able to keep with his father in combat and he's also capable of fighting off multiple foes by himself. Another impressive display of combat is shown duringRagnarökduring the final fight withOdin, where Atreus helps his father andFreyatake down the Allfather with a combination of acrobatics and melee combat.Archery Skills/Staffmanship: Atreus uses a bow as his primary weapon in combat. He can use it not just for shooting enemies but also as a blunt weapon, akin to staff in combat to hit or choke them. His archery skills keeps getting better throughout the journey; at the beginning, he was too distracted and didn't have an accurate aim but he got calmer and that made his aim better. His archery skills rapidly improved during their journey; both his speed in aiming accuracy and his speed in charging. Later, he was able to shoot arrow after arrow, as Atreus demonstrated when he and Kratos fought Baldur for the very last time.Axemanship: It was worth noting that Atreus was able to use his mother's axe in combat when Kratos lent it to him, although how proficient he was with it was not shown.

- Atreus' Knife: After Atreus sacrificed his mother's knife to save his father, he received a new knife from his father. The new knife was one of the two knives that Kratos made the day Atreus was born. It was made of a mix of metals fromKratos' homelandand metals from thelands they were currently in. One of the pair of knives was made for Kratos himself and the other knife was made to be given to Atreus the day he was ready to wield it. Atreus, in his arrogance after discovering he was part god, notes that the knife is much better than Faye's Knife.

## Trivia

## In Mythology

- At the end of the story, it is revealed that Atreus is namedLokibyhis mother. He shares several similarities with his counterpart from the Norse myths:Both of their mothers are namedLaufey. On the mural inJötunheim, Kratos' name is written asFárbauti(ᚠᚨᚱᛒᚨᚢᛏᛁ), which is the name of Loki's father in the myths, and Atreus bear the name: ᛚᛟᚲᛁ - which translates to Loki.After learning of his godhood, Atreus asks his father if he can transform into an animal, such as a wolf; Loki in the mythology is infamous for shapeshifting into various animals and other beings. Sure enough by the events ofGod of War: Ragnarök, Atreus has learned how to harness his Spartan Rage to transform into a bear and a wolf, though it is unknown if he can transform into other animals such as a bird.Atreus causesBaldur's death by breaking the spell with a mistletoe arrow shard and alerts Kratos to him trying to kill Freya forcing the latter to intervene to put him out of his misery; Loki causes Baldur's death by giving the blind god Höðr a mistletoe arrow, and then tricking him into shooting Baldur.Mimirsays thatJörmungandrsomehow recognizes Atreus;Jörmungandris a son of Loki in the myths. When Atreus confronts Mimir saying it is impossible, Mimir replies the serpent might have been talking about the future, since it is said that the clash between Jörmungandr andThorduringRagnarökwill be so catastrophic that it'll splinterYggdrasiland send the World Serpent back in time, before its own birth.Freya's comment about the serpent mysteriously appearing one day in theLake of Nineseems to support this theory. A Jötnar Shrine confirms Jörmungandr is the son of "Loki" andAngrboða.

- In mythology, Loki had two younger siblings named Helblindi and Býleistr, but it's highly likely they don't exist in the God of War universe since Atreus is the only son of Kratos and Faye and there are no indications that Atreus ever had other siblings apart fromCalliope.
- In mythology, Loki is also believed to be the mother of Sleipnir, Odin's horse. This was a result of Loki transforming into a mare to distract Svaðilfari so he would fail the wager against Odin.

## In General

- The original developer of the originalGod of War,David Jaffe, said it would be "very cool" if Atreus is gay when he is older, commenting games as a medium struggle with LGBT representation.[4]Jaffe also said,"If Atreus is gay, why would it ruin the franchise? The God damn truth is that under the surface they are homophobic.”[5]
- Atreus is the second characterKratosfights alongside with, the first beingDeimos. He is also the first character to accompany Kratos throughout the story, the second being Freya after Atreus go on his personal mission.
- Like his father and uncle, he has markings on the left side of his face. Though very faint, the markings look similar to both his father's tattoo and uncle's birthmark.
- The A.I. for Atreus changes as the main story continues. After being told of his godhood, he starts attacking enemies by himself with his knife, even firing arrows without Kratos saying so or even engage not hostile enemies and will sometimes refuse to help or pick Kratos up if Kratos falls in battle. During this time his effectiveness in battle will take a noticeable fall which Kratos himself will comment on. If he is angry at Kratos, Atreus will not help him in some battles, even leaving Kratos to fend for himself. However, after Atreus was reprimanded by Kratos, Atreus now always helps his father in battle and always helps him get up, restoring much of his efficiency as a partner in the game, although he still attacks others even without Kratos commanding him to.
- Atreus is the fifth character in the series to kill a God counting Kratos,Zeus(who technically killed Kratos),MagniandModi(who killedNerthus) and afterwards,Odin(who killed[1]Thor) andSurtr(who killedFreyrand likely many more inRagnarök).
- Similar to, Kratos, Atreus is ambidextrous despite preferring his left hand more often.
- When Atreus speaks in ancient Jötunn or is about to transform into his wolf or bear forms, his eyes glow bright bluish-green.
- GameSpot erroneously credited the nameCharlieas the name of Atreus after the game's reveal in the E3 2016. At the time, Atreus' name was kept secret. The nameCharliestuck as a joke.[6]The writers promised directorCory Barlogthat they would implement the joke at some point in the story, but refused to tell him where.The giant tortoise Freya lives below of was namedChaurlibecause of this. When Atreus addresses the tortoise by his name, Kratos shows disgust at the name.

- Atreus is partially based on Creative DirectorCory Barlog's own son. Aspects of the game like Atreus having to translate Old Norse to Kratos were inspired by real-life situations he had with his son.
- Atreus has wooden figures ofThor, Sleipnir, andDauði Kaupmaðr.
- When Atreus was dying due to the activation of his godly powers, a red storm (with its epicenter located above their cabin) started. According to Cory Barlog, it is a symptom of the world reacting to Atreus' dying state. This is a nod to the previous trilogy, where the death of theGreek Godscaused various disasters.[7]This is contradicted by the novel, where it is implied thatthe Gods ofthe landwere trying to prevent Kratos from achieving his objective of saving his son.However, the Novel itself is not a faithful adaptation of the game, with several details of the main quest missing from the novel, such as Atreus verbally hurting Sindri after they had learned of the Black Rune ofJötunheimmissing from the novel.

- Atreus and his offspring are the only known characters to have blood from different worlds, being descendants of both the Greek Gods and the Jötnar. In fact, Atreus' mixed heritage caused Heimdall to mockingly refer to him as a 'half-breed’.
- Atreus' funerary prayer in the beginning of the game is based on Buliwyf's from the filmThe 13th Warrior.
- Kratos frequent use of the term "boy" to call Atreus has become recurring jokes amongst fans and even various memes are produced based on it.At theGame Awards 2018, Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic, the voice actors of Kratos and Atreus, respectively, were chosen to announce an award. Telling Suljic to read the award winner, Judge said, "Read it, boy", referencing this meme, much to the audience's delight.

- During the cutscene where Atreus enters Spartan Rage, red arcs of electricity can be seen pulsing across his torso. Whether these hint at some kind of electrokinesis or are simply aesthetic is unknown.
- If the player returns to Helheim before being forced there by Baldur, Atreus will complain about the cold, saying that "This is unreasonable, I've seen enough."
- The name of Atreus' bear form, Björn, alludes the eponymous prince from a Norse folktale who was cursed into a bear by a witch and was subsequently slain by his father without knowing, which is surprisingly fitting considering the circumstances revolving their transformation culminated to them confronting their fathers. Yet whereas the former transformed due to an outside influence and perished in the end, Atreus unknowingly turned into a bear with his own growing divine powers and survived Kratos' killing blow albeit left incapacitated to the point of reverting to his human form.
- Atreus appears in 'bot formAstro Botwith the moniker "Boy" His description reads "Get him angry and things might turn grizzly..." This refers to the fact that he became Björn in game.

- The writers promised directorCory Barlogthat they would implement the joke at some point in the story, but refused to tell him where.
- The giant tortoise Freya lives below of was namedChaurlibecause of this. When Atreus addresses the tortoise by his name, Kratos shows disgust at the name.
