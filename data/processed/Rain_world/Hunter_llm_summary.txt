Here is a concise summary of the information about Hunter from the Rain World wiki:

The Hunter is a red Slugcat and the hard mode of Rain World.
It is unlocked after completing Monkor Survivor. 
The Hunter has a fierce metabolism requiring a steady diet of meat, but its stomach also won't be the only concern due to extreme peril on its path. 
The Hunter starts with a special green Neuron Fly and an aquamarine Pearl in their stomach, and can carry a Spear on their back. 
Its cycles start at 19 and count down, becoming more weak and spasming after cycle 0, requiring even more food to survive. 
The Hunter has unique creatures that don't spawn for other Slugcats, including Red Lizard, Cyan Lizard, Spitter Spider, King Vulture, and Red Centipede.
