## Story[]

While fleeing from theVision Hunt Decree, Kazuha had heard that his friend had challenged the Vision Hunters to a duel before the throne. Kazuha's friend dueled with Kujou Sara, who had accepted the duel on Beelzebul's behalf inTenshukaku, where the defeated would face divine punishment from the Raiden Shogun. When Kazuha arrived, the duel was over and his friend had lost. Kazuha ran away with his friend's dying vision in his hand.[3]

## Legacy[]

Kazuha would later try to find someone to resonate with his friend'sMasterless Vision, even askingBeidouto host the annualCrux Clashwith it as a reward. Unfortunately, no one, not even the Traveler, was able to resonate with it. Kazuha then spent some time roamingLiyueto see if anyone was able to, but he was unable to find anyone before being recalled to the Crux for the trip to Inazuma.

In a cutscene during theArchon QuestThe Omnipresent GodinChapter II: Act III -Omnipresence Over Mortals, Kazuha is seen wearing his friend's Masterless Vision next to his own Anemo Vision. When the Traveler leavesTenshukakuand was immediately attacked by the Shogun (despite saying they could leave the place alive), the Masterless Vision returns to its original state as his friend's words echo again: "There will always be those who dare to brave the lightning's glow." This second Vision allows Kazuha to harness both the power ofAnemoand Electro at once, which he uses to successfully block the Shogun's attack, saving the Traveler. The Electro Vision is then sent flying by the Shogun's blade, falling to the floor and deactivating once again.

As many people were unaware of the Masterless Vision and many Inazumans revered the Shogun, they believed that it was simply inconceivable or that he had used aDelusiondue to eye-witnesses seeing him use both Anemo and Electro.[4]Word of the feat also caught up toScaramouche, now reformed into theWanderer, who was amused and impressed by the feat.[5]

## Broken Blade Mound[]

His sword can be found in a small ravine north-east of theGrand Narukami Shrine. In the ending cinematic of The Omnipresent God, Kazuha can be seen placing his friend's Masterless Vision next to the sword. After completing The Omnipresent God, the Masterless Vision can be seen near the mound, along with aSapphirecat.
