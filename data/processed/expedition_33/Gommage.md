Gommageis a yearly solemn ceremony that the residents ofLumièreface after the Fracture.

## History[]

After what became known as the Fracture that split Lumière off from the rest of the world, a giant monolith appeared on the skyline with the glowing number "100" on it. The people soon learned that on a prescribed day every year, a large, mysterious being that became known as thePaintresswould appear and change the number, counting down each year and with it, "erasing" all those of that age and older from their city. This effectively killed them while also lowering the population's age limit, pushing it closer and closer to an inevitable annihilation.

Over time, the Lumierans began to hold a farewell ceremony on the prescribed day every year for those that would inevitably die when the Paintress would change the number at sunset. This ceremony evolved to have those going through the gommage to wear garlands of white and red flowers from their loved ones and saying their final goodbyes before heading to the harbor to watch the monolith countdown. As many also end up as orphans before they reach adulthood, many orphanages have sprung up, along with many others volunteering to be guardians and foster children until their own untimely Gommage.

As an offshoot from this and the very first year the Fracture happened,expeditionsof those willing to die sooner started to surface, typically heading out the day after a Gommage to give them the best chance to face the unknown before their own Gommage.

The Gommage was first discovered in Monolith Year 85, when two pairs of 85 year-old twins were killed by it. This spurred the Council of Lumière to resume the Expeditions to the Continent, only instead of searching for survivors of the Fracture, they would try and stop the Paintress from triggering it ever again.

## Notes[]

- It's indicated that the way people die in Lumière upon the sunset at the end of the annual day of Gommage, by turning into ashes/rose petals and effectively disappearing, has something to do with theirChromaleaving their bodies. This is in particular contrast with the bodies of past Expeditioners that are found on theContinent, who were presumably slain by hostileNevrons; here, their Chroma stays trapped in their bodies that remain in place, instead of disappearing like they do during a Gommage.

## Trivia[]

- Gommage means "to erase" in French.
