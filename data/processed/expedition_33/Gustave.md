## Background[]

A widely respected engineer inLumière, Gustave has devoted much of his life to the betterment of the city. Among his contributions to Lumière's agriculture is Aquafarm 3, a project he took part in alongsideScielandSophiethat secured food supply for many neighbourhoods. He also helped reinforce Lumière's Shield Dome and other aspects of its defence. With the support of his research partnerLune, he created the Lumina Converter, a device that would allow Expeditioners to better harnessChroma, and usePictosmore efficiently.

Gustave has a sister,Emma, who serves as chief councilor of Lumière. Alongside Emma, he isMaelle's guardian, and has acted as both a brother and a father-like figure to her since the loss of her biological parents at the age of three. Gustave also has several other children apprenticed to him, who he hopes will continue his work after he is gone.

Gustave was in a relationship with Sophie, a pairing many in Lumière spoke positively of. The relationship became strained as a result of their differing opinions over whether or not to have children in a world without any real future, owing to theGommage; this eventually led to their split. The two remained on friendly terms, but did not have much contact over the next few years.

At some point Gustave suffered the loss of his left forearm. At his request, his apprentices created an electric prosthetic arm as a replacement.

## Expedition 33[]

Four years after their relationship ended, Gustave reconnects with Sophie and supports her on the day she and others of her age are due to Gommage. The two acknowledge their feelings for each other before her passing. Sophie's death has a profound effect on Gustave and provides a driving force in his quest to destroy thePaintressas a member ofExpedition 33.

Expedition 33 meets catastrophe upon landing on theContinent. Most of the Expeditioners are killed by a white-haired man and his army ofNoirs, while the few survivors are sent scattering across the land. Gustave finds himself waking up near a waterfall inSpring Meadows. Stumbling upon the bodies of his compatriots and believing that all is lost, he attempts suicide but is stopped by Lune. He resolves to keep going, in part for the sake of Maelle. The two track down Maelle at theManorafter going through a portal inFlying Waters. They are later joined by Sciel after unexpectedly finding themselves facing her in the arena at theGestral Village. Over the course of their journey, Gustave duly records his travel and exploration on the Continent, hoping that one day his apprentices will be able to read them in his journal.

After reachingStone Wave Cliffsand retrieving "Florrie", one ofEsquie'smagic rocks with which they could cross another sea, the Expedition is again confronted by the white-haired man,Renoir. After a brief and lopsided battle that depletes his prosthetic arm of its remaining energy, Gustave dies defending Maelle. The arm, his journal and the Lumina Converter are later retrieved byVersoand brought to the surviving members of the Expedition.

Some time after, Verso suggests a spot near theForgotten Battlefieldwhere they can "bury" Gustave. A small memorial is created there, and the prosthetic arm is left atop a burial mound. Each member pays their final respects, symbolically laying him to rest.

After the Expedition defeats the Paintress and returns to Lumière, Maelle delivers the news of Gustave's death to Emma and Gustave's apprentices, leaving them heartbroken.

Much later, after the revelations regarding Maelle's identity and the truth of the Canvas world, Verso admits to Maelle that he could have saved Gustave but chose not to. He reasons that Maelle would not have allowed him to banish the Paintress, in reality their mother Aline, from the Canvas if she knew it would result in Gustave being Gommage'd.

In the Epilogue 'A Life to Paint', following Maelle's ending, Gustave is resurrected alongside everyone else in Lumière. He appears to have rekindled his relationship with Sophie. The two are joined by Maelle, Lune, and Sciel at Verso's concert at the opera house.
